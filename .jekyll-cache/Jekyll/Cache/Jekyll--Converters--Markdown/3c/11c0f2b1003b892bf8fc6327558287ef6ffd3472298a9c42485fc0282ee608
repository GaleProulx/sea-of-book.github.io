<p>Fade was not one of those tired students. Her feet sat upon the ancient wooden desk with the hard heel of her boot slowly grinding away the already scratched surface. All of her attention lay outside the classroom into the red-hued sky promising that the sun would once again rise to fill the room with light. The tops of some mountains were barely visible from the window when a cloud wasnâ€™t passing by. She longed to explore the great valley below where supposed terrible beasts lay waiting to strike anyone stupid enough to clamber down to the ground. Of course, that was the tale. If her suspicions were correct, all that fear mongering is for a completely different purpose than protecting the â€œpoor unintelligent peopleâ€ from their own curiosity.</p>
