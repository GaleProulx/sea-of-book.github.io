I"ì<p>The room was dark, with the only light coming from a poorly lit monitor. The computer made a soft humming sound to a silent room. A woman sat at a desk fighting. Her hand could not force her finger down. Tears slowly welled in her eyes because her finger refused to come down. An email of resignation filled the monitor. It was dated over a nine months ago, yet her finger would not come down. Behind that email were various windows of code and writing. Her mindâ€™s work splayed across the screen in layers upon layers. Melodies sung through programs that worked flawlessly. Emotions sprung through documentation. Attempt after attempt to write something that meant anything lay behind the email. Unfortunately, that was all they were: attempts. It had taken her this long to learn that at the end of the day, no one gave a damn how beautiful your documentation was. Rich idiots didnâ€™t care how your algorithm made them money. All this work was for nothing. At least to her it was for nothing.</p>
