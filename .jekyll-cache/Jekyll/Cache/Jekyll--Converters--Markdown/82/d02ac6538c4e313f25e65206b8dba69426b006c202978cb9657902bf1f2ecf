<p>Google Analytics without the features of sharing data anonymously. The only person looking at this anonymous data should be me.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-data-is-actually-being-collected">What is data is actually being collected?</h1>

<p>I am collecting data on how many users are visiting this website, what country they are from, session duration, what pages that user is visiting, what device you are using to visit the website, and at what time. All of this data is anonymous. None of this data is being shared with Google for analysis. (Data is being stored on their servers.)</p>

<h1 id="why-is-this-necessary">Why is this necessary?</h1>

<p>Knowing what traffic is entering this site helps me know whether or not I’m reaching my audience. Any big website today will be tracking this information. That being said, I do not have the ability, nor would I violate my ethical code of conduct, to search for an individual’s information. This information is purely so I can see if this website is progressing or not.</p>
