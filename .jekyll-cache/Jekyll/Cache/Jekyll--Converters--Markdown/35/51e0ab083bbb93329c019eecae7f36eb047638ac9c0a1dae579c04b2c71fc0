I"•<p>Rolling into the parking lot was, under normal circumstances, an absurdly yellow van. Fortunately for Sebastian and Ferdinand, the parking lot of this bar, â€œDrunk Till Daylight,â€ was filled with rainbow and bright colored vehicles making it almost not absurd enough.</p>

<p>â€œYou know what they say, right?â€ Ferdinand asked Sebastian. â€œNinth time is the charm! Just remember Iâ€™m not leaving this bar until Iâ€™ve kissed at least three guys.â€ The van slowed down as they found their parking space and started to pull in. â€œOr it could be more. I wouldnâ€™t mind a little more than kissing.â€</p>

<p>Sebastian gave Ferdinand the stink eye as he stopped the van causing the vehicle to gently rock back and forth in the depressed pavement unable to keep its shape from so many cars before parking in the same spot. â€œI guess thatâ€™s a goal.â€ Slowly, Sebastian took his gaze off of Ferdinandâ€™s smiling face. He looked like he was serious.</p>

<p>â€œSebastian, you always have the attitude of a wet sack of potatoes. Did I ever tell you that?â€ The driver side door opened up and Ferdinand hit the ground rather ungraciously.</p>

<p>â€œThatâ€™s not a saying! That just isnâ€™t a thing!â€ The passenger side door opened revealing Sebastian stepping out of the vehicle. â€œAnd no, youâ€™ve never told me that before.â€</p>

<p>â€œLighten up, Seebass! We have all the time in the world. The night is young.â€ Sebastian pulled out his phone and pointed at it. The clock read 12:00AM. â€œOkay fine, most bars close in an hour but we still have time!â€</p>

<p>Their shoes tapped on the pavement leading up to the front doors. All along the outer woodworking were phrases scribbled in marker reading â€œMawwiage is wat bwings us togeder!â€ and â€œLuv is Luvâ€. The front door swung open to reveal a wide array of fashion choices from hats far to large to wear in such a small space to anything that showed more skin than not. Many left their shirts unbuttoned showing abs, pecs, and muscles galore.</p>

<p>â€œExhibit A.â€ Ferdinand let his hand take a sweeping motion as if showing off the latest and greatest bodies in history. â€œIf we are not successful it will only be from our own undoing.â€</p>

<p>Shoes yet again tapped, this time on old wooden floorboards squeaking but barely heard over the crowd of conversations flooding the old, bright and faded walls. The two men strolled up to the bar. â€œWhat can I get for you folks?â€ the bar tender asked.</p>

<p>â€œMargaritas please!â€ Before Sebastian could react Ferdinand tripped him into a stool and gazed into Sebastianâ€™s eyes. â€œSeebass, did I ever tell you your eyes glow like diamonds? Too bad they are dulled down by your aura.â€</p>

<p>Quickly Sebastian pulled his gaze from Ferdinand desperately trying to find a part of the room to stare at that wasnâ€™t in someone elseâ€™s eyes. â€œOne day Ferdinand. One day,â€ Sebastian threatened. His eyes continued to sweep the room until he found a nice group of people sitting in a corner booth. They all looked like they were having the time of their lives. <em>Why did they have to be so cute when they smiled?</em> Sebastian asked himself. â€œWhat do you think of that group Ferdy?â€</p>

<p>Ferdinandâ€™s head instantly flicked to where Sebastian was pointing. â€œNice, not very muscular though.â€ The bartender gave them their drinks. As Ferdinand started slurping up his margarita he commented, â€œthat hair though. Why canâ€™t I have hair? Itâ€™s not fair.â€ Instinctively Sebastian ran his hand through his luscious locks. â€œOh shut up! Not every was blessed with good looks.â€ Sebastian quickly took his hand down.</p>

<p>As Sebastian stopped ogling the group of impossibly beautiful humans, his eyes stopped on a very familiar face. Brown skin, typical nerd glasses, flat hair, jaw sculpted by an angel, chest as bear as any womanâ€™s. His name was Ricardo. Nothing held a flame to his IQ. Basically a certified genius. Also, Sebastianâ€™s ex boyfriend. â€œFerdinand!â€ whispered Sebastian quietly. â€œCode red! Code red! Ricardo, 3 oâ€™clock!â€</p>

<p>Ferdinandâ€™s head yet again flung instantly in Ricardoâ€™s direction. â€œOh hey, that is him! Should we say hi?â€</p>

<p>â€œWhat? No! Absolutely not! We are leaving now!â€ Sebastian waved the bar tender over.</p>

<p>â€œBut Sebastian, whereâ€™s my three kisses?â€ Ferdinand whined. The waiter gave the check. It was Sebastianâ€™s turn to pay. â€œNo no, I got this.â€ Ferdinand took the check.</p>

<p>â€œIsnâ€™t it my turn?â€ Sebastian shot Ferdinand a dirty look. â€œWell at least let me pay for the tip. Just let me go to the bathroom.â€ Sebastian made his way to the one door labeled â€œFree For Allâ€ accompanied by male and female stereotypical gender symbols.</p>

<p>When Sabastian exited the bathroom, Ferdinand was in the middle of handing the bar tender the check. â€œOh no you donâ€™t!â€ Sebastian swiped the check out of Ferdinandâ€™s hands before it reached the bar tenders and paid for the whole thing. â€œNice try. I know itâ€™s mine turn.â€</p>

<p>They headed back to the van where Ferdinand, like a child, laid down on the hood complaining. â€œBut Sebastian, I didnâ€™t get one kiss!â€ Suddenly, Ferdinand fell off the van. It was moving. It slowly toppled off the hill the of the parking lot and started falling towards the McDonaldâ€™s located next to the bar.</p>

<p>â€œYou forgot to put the car in park, not neutral, didnâ€™t you?â€ Sebastian gave a disappointed look as Ferdinand raced down the hill. The van dented the side of the McDonaldâ€™s nearly giving a pedestrian a heart attack.</p>
