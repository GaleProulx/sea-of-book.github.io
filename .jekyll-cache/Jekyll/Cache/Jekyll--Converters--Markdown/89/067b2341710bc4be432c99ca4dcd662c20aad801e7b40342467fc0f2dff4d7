I"¬0<p>Wind roared through the gondola, but that did not stop Fade from hearing the woman correctly. She said â€œmanipulatorsâ€. Within the past couple of days that word was coming up far too often to be a coincidence. Fade stared at the woman with squinting eyes.</p>

<p>â€œDo you think the guards saw our faces?â€ Obli asked Vious.</p>

<p>â€œOf course they did, we were looking right at them,â€ Vious responded. Obli bit their lip with worry. â€œDonâ€™t worry babe, they canâ€™t arrest us for catching a person.â€ Her face quickly turned from a softness she only showed her family to being very crossed. â€œAnd who the hell do you think you are dragging our family into your business?â€ She shoved her finger straight at the womanâ€™s face.</p>

<p>â€œWoah woah! I didnâ€™t do anything but hitch a ride,â€ the woman pointed out.</p>

<p>Vious stood up. â€œYou know thatâ€™s a damn lie. Guards are going to show up to our house tonight because of you.â€ She grabbed the mysterious woman by the collar. â€œSo. Iâ€™m asking again, who the hell are you?â€</p>

<p>The woman only kept her cool for a second before Vious lifted her over the railing leaving her upper body dangling out of the gondola. The cage was leaning at a rather harsh angle. Both Fade and Obli had to hold on to the railing.</p>

<p>With a yelp she said, â€œTerra! My name is Terra! I swear itâ€™s Terra!â€ Vious didnâ€™t pull her back in. â€œI suppose you also want my status. I report to the highest level of command!â€</p>

<p>Like it took no effort at all, Vious lifted Terra with one arm back into the gondola and planted her firmly in a seat. She gave Terra a stern look before taking her place besides Obli.</p>

<p>Fade blinked a few times in disbelief. Apparently she was the only one wildly out of the loop. â€œHighest level of command?â€ Fade asked.</p>

<p>â€œDonâ€™t,â€ Vious commanded while pinching her nose. She hadnâ€™t looked this frustrated since the night Fade was dropped off home by a guard who had caught her climbing a rather precarious pipe. â€œWhat am I supposed to do? Thereâ€™s no way we arenâ€™t going to be investigated for thisâ€¦â€</p>

<p>Terraâ€™s eyes lit up with excitement. â€œYou obviously donâ€™t get it. I report to the highest level of command, so Iâ€™m the best of the best.â€ Everyone looked at her with confusion. She started over again. Pointing towards the Fifth Division she started talking. â€œYou see that weâ€™re almost there? Undoubtably there will be guards waiting for me.â€</p>

<p>â€œFor us,â€ Vious interjected.</p>

<p>â€œGet over yourself,â€ Terra snapped back. â€œThey just want me. Just act fearful, Iâ€™ll look menacing as I jump out of the cart. Feel free to point them in the direction that I leave. Cooperate with the guards.â€</p>

<p>â€œThat doesnâ€™t change anything! They saw us catch you.â€ Obli pointed out.</p>

<p>â€œClaim ignorance,â€ Terra offered. â€œYou didnâ€™t know who I was, and no one can blame you for wanting to catch a person from falling down.â€</p>

<p>â€œThis is a terrible idea,â€ Vious muttered.</p>

<p>Before anyone had the time to debate the plan further, the Fifth Division gondola station was approaching. Both Vious and Fade moved towards Obli at one end of the gondola making the whole thing tilt their direction. Terra stood on the seats at the other end and started yelling profanities Fade didnâ€™t even know existed.</p>

<p>Predictably, a crowd of guards were waiting for us. Most of them had batons at the ready, with one guard holding a long wooden rifle with a bayonet attached. At least, Fade assumed it was a rifle. She had never seen one before. A citizen of the Fifth Division wasnâ€™t worth the bullets.</p>

<p>In a very surreal moment, Terra jumped off the gondola at the last second dropping to a floor below the one they were heading to.  When she performed her immaculate stunt, they all went rushing towards the staircase. She proceeded to drop from floor to lower floor catching herself at each level as she fell. It was absolute insanity. One slip up and sheâ€™d be lost to a 4000 foot drop. It was a wonder the wind didnâ€™t carry her away as she fell.</p>

<p>Fade heard Vious and Obli give audible sighs as the gondola locked into the station without a single guard there to wait for them. It appears no one really did care they were on the same gondola as Terra.</p>

<p>As Vious pushed the both of them out of the metal deathtrap she muttered, â€œcanâ€™t we just have one day to ourselves?â€</p>

<p>Both feet planted firmly on the ground, Fade took a deep breath. She had run ins with guards before, but it was always for small things. To see that many waiting for one woman was an unbelievable sight. Even now she could hear their stomping boots as they left the station. She could only assume Terra had made it out way before the guards could scuttle down the stairs.</p>

<p>â€œCome on Fade. Letâ€™s go home,â€ Vious whispered into her ear as she wrapped her arm around her.</p>

<p>Fade always loved it when her mom held her close. It didnâ€™t happen very often. Of her two parents, Vious was typically the one to be more reserved with her affection.</p>

<p>â€œDonâ€™t I get to join?â€ Obli asked. Before Fade could object, she was sandwiched in between her parents. â€œWhat a day! I cannot believe we met Professor Fog and Terra and that lovely guard your mom will not tell us the name of!â€ they said to no one in particular.</p>

<p>Viousâ€™s face went red. â€œI told you, heâ€™s a nice man. What more do you want?â€</p>

<p>Fade tried her best to pretend she wasnâ€™t there as they exited the station, which was extraordinarily hard as she was sandwiched in between the two of them.</p>

<p>â€œA heads up is all,â€ Obli requested. â€œI donâ€™t like surprises, like when manipulators just casually jump onto your gondola.â€</p>

<p>With a long sigh Vious looked up into the sky with nothing else to say. The conversation was over, at least for now. Fade hated it when the two bickered. She usually wasnâ€™t blessed with such close proximity to their arguments. The tension between them was unbearable.</p>

<p>As the sun set they finally reached their home towards the outer edge of the Fifth Division. Fade ran ahead, unlocked the door, and ran straight up to her room. While she absolutely had fun, the day was a little too eventful for her tastes. Crawling up onto her bed, she bundled into a blanket to watch the sun set from her little window. The sight was always beautiful, even if she didnâ€™t have a view of the ground below. The clouds filled the sky like an open white canvas. Red streaks overlapped with orange streaks cut off by random shadows making it look like an endless field. She always wanted to take an airship far off where all the rumbling of wind on sheet metal would dissipate into nothingness. Where complete and utter silence could exist.</p>

<p>A jarring knock at her bedroom door stirred Fade from the beautiful sight. â€œCome in,â€ Fade squeaked.</p>

<p>As expected, Obli poked her head in before entering the room. â€œDid you have fun today?â€ they asked. Fade nodded in response. â€œLook, Fade. I want to apologize for earlier.â€ They sat on the bed and offered an arm. Without hesitating, Fade cuddled next to her Nini. â€œI didnâ€™t mean to roast mom. That was wrong of me. She does one hell of a lot of work to keep this house standing.â€</p>

<p>â€œI know,â€ Fade affirmed.</p>

<p>â€œThat being said, sometimes she stresses me out. I still love her which is why itâ€™s upsetting to see her have to stretch such great lengths and suffer in silence. It breaks my heart.â€ A tear started to form in their eye. â€œIâ€™m sorry we canâ€™t do better.â€</p>

<p>Unsure of what she was missing, Fade figured it was best to not press the issue. â€œFor what itâ€™s worth, I think your doing pretty good.â€ A moment after she spoke Obli started sniffling and hugging Fade so tight she couldnâ€™t breath. â€œNini, please! Your crushing my rib cage!â€ Slowly the sniffling turned into giggles as they continued to give an absolute bear hug.</p>

<p>Moments later Vious entered the room. â€œGlad to see you two are having fun.â€ At this point Fade was pushing Obli away who was very satisfied with themselves for torturing Fade with affection.</p>

<p>â€œThatâ€™s one way to put itâ€¦â€ Fade responded while jumping off the bed finally escaping their grasp. â€œBy the way, Iâ€™ve been meaning to ask. What are Manipulators? Multiple people have said that word and Iâ€™ve never heard it used as a title.â€</p>

<p>Viousâ€™s face dropped into disappointment. â€œI knew you were going to ask that,â€ she muttered. â€œLong story short, Manipulators are citizens who feel that things need to be run differently around here: literally. Theyâ€™re known to be very talented at running through the city without being detected.â€ She leaned against the wall and looked up at the ceiling. â€œNaturally, theyâ€™re really good at doing illegal stuff.â€</p>

<p>â€œLike graffiti?â€ asked Fade. They sounded like the type of people who could reach scaffolding on the pillar. Maybe Professor Fog was referencing Manipulators with his drawings he showed last class.</p>

<p>Obli smiled. â€œYes, graffiti is one thing they do.â€</p>

<p>â€œThey do a lot worse,â€ Vious added. â€œPoint is if you donâ€™t want to be arrested, donâ€™t talk to them. And no climbing on buildings! I donâ€™t want you taking inspiration from Terra. Youâ€™ve already given us enough trouble showing up home with a guard escorting you.â€</p>

<p>Echoing from down the stairs three loud knocks rattled the front door. It was almost as if they spoke a guard into existence.</p>

<p>â€œSpeaking of which,â€ Vious trailed off as they slipped down the stairs.</p>

<p>Obli and Fade stayed upstairs peering down at the front just within earshot. The door was only slightly ajar, making it impossible to see the guard.</p>

<p>â€œWhat do you want?â€ Vious asked with a rather stern voice.</p>

<p>â€œEvening,â€ the guard greeted. â€œDo you have a moment for a few questions?â€</p>

<p>The guards were always polite at night. Something about a long days worth of work really wore down the stone-faced attitude.</p>

<p>â€œWhat do you want?â€ Vious repeated.</p>

<p>â€œDid you see this woman?â€ the guard whispered. It was hard to see from so far away. Fade could only guess what was going on. Vious didnâ€™t open the door all the way. She peered down at what was probably a photograph.</p>

<p>â€œSure did. She jumped into our gondola today. Then she jumped out.â€</p>

<p>â€œSo you have no association with this woman?â€ the guard pressed.</p>

<p>â€œNope. Never seen her in my life until today.â€ Vious stood back up and started biting her lip.</p>

<p>There was a long pause before the guard talked again. â€œAlright, that will be all for tonight. Good evening to you.â€</p>

<p>Without replying Vious closed the door and looked back up to Fade and Obli. â€œI told you that woman was nothing but trouble.â€</p>

<p>Obli walked down the stairs to join her. â€œAgreed. I am about ready to fall over. Letâ€™s get some rest.â€</p>

<p>Fadeâ€™s parents waved goodnight and went to their bedroom. Taking a step back, a wave of exhaustion swept over her as well. Stumbling back into her room, she flopped onto her bed too tired to take off her clothes. Drifting off into a deep sleep, Fade let her mind wander through all the things she saw at the museum.</p>

<p>Until there was a tapping noise. Opening her eyes, her room was pitch black. Only the moonlight lit a small part of room seeping in from her dusty old window. And there it was again. A tapping noise. Almost like a fingernail on glass. Lazily getting up, Fade looked out into the night.</p>

<p>Slowly from below her field of view, a head lifted itself right up to the window. Freaking out, Fade jumped back off her bed and stumbled into her desk miraculously not knocking anything over. Taking a second glance, she could make out a few details. Long hair, wide eyes, and fingers clutching the window sill which was definitely the only thing keeping the woman from falling. It was Terra. No one would scale the side of her house and somehow not fall. It had to be Terra.</p>

<p>In an attempt to get her to go away, Fade tapped on the window with a little bit more ferocity and a very cross face. Obviously it didnâ€™t work, as she gave a thumbs up and disappeared.</p>
