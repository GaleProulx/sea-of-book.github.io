I"E'<p>Normally travel to Volida’s Peak would only take a third of a day. Unfortunately, Chelsen’s pace was much slower due to the unbelievable darkness that filled the forest and the increasing effort it took just to breath. He knew the infection was spreading at a fairly fast pace as his shoulder was now showing the same bruising his forehead. Sunrise had hit when Chelsen was approaching Volida’s Peak. By now the infection was starting to spread fairly deep into the forest. He guessed it would only be a few days before the black dust had reached Iris. It was hard to imagine there was anything left of Frelia at this point.</p>

<p>Chelsen went north back to Volida’s house in hopes that maybe he had missed some sign that this whole situation was on the horizon. Most of the house was in tact with clear signs that it would not be that way for long. One of the walls was developing a rather large hole. Limping inside, Chelsen found that most of the papers and journals that were scattered about before were either decaying or completely gone. While the structure of the house was not yet gone, everything inside it had pretty much disappeared.</p>

<p>Cursing under his breath, Chelsen slowly wobbled his way south along Volida’s Peak looking up. He was hoping to potentially find where the meteor crashed. Now that the cliffs were barren, it would hopefully be easier to see above the cliff. As Chelsen reached the southern edge of the cliff nothing was shown. Frustrated, Chelsen made his way to the closed off entrance and furiously started pounding his fists on the cliff. “Why?” he yelled. “I know you’re real!” Defeated and out of breath, Chelsen slid down the rocks onto the ground. The plague was taking a lot of energy out of him.</p>

<p>Before he knew what he was doing, his eyes closed. Chelsen slipped out of consciousness with his head awkwardly lying on the base of the cliff.</p>

<p>Sunset filled the sky with red light when his head slammed to the ground. Stunned, Chelsen spent a few minutes just staring into the sky. He hadn’t realized he was out for that long. It wasn’t that far past morning when he had reached the spot he apparently had been taking a nap in. Looking down at his body, it was obvious that the infection was spreading even faster. All down his leg there were bruises. Almost half of his body was covered. At this rate, he would die in another couple of days. He tried to get up but his muscles screamed with pain.</p>

<p>It took a few minutes for Chelsen to reach up behind his head to the cliff for support. Odd enough, as he reached his hand back there was nothing there. Trying to not move as much as possible, Chelsen tilted his head back. The entrance had surely enough reappeared. Darkness consumed the hallways as usual, but there was still plants growing in the hallway. Unlike the barren landscape now surrounding Volida’s Peak, there appeared to be life inside the peak!</p>

<p>Excited, Chelsen tried to prop himself up on one arm only to fall back down to the ground in pain. He was in no condition to walk. Taking a brief moment to let the pain subside, he used all his strength to flip himself off his back and onto his belly. Making sure to take breaks in between every pull, he slowly started crawling through the entrance deeper into the peak.</p>

<p>Halfway through the hallway Chelsen heard footsteps. Trying to utter for words of help, the noises that came out of his dry mouth were much more like a shriek. The footsteps seemed to approach without taking notice to his strange noises. Soon, he was being lifted up and carried deeper into the peak straight towards the mysterious room. Unreasonably smooth, cold hands wrapped around his shoulders. When the blue light flooded his vision, Chelsen had his first real chance to look at who was carrying him. At either side of him was simply a warped reflection of his face. He looked absolutely awful as the plague had almost completely covered his head. Whatever being was carrying him was one he had never seen before. They were almost invisible creatures reflecting everything that was around them onto their silhouette.</p>

<p>Panic tried to bubble up in his brain but was quickly subdued by slipping in and out of consciousness when he was laid to rest on the tree.</p>

<p>What felt like for hours the invisible creatures poked and prodded him. Every so often the creature would glow blinding Chelsen as they touched his skin causing a warm tingling sensation at the point of contact.</p>

<p>Completely losing track of time, Chelsen woke up again to a blue light completely obscuring his vision. Most of his body was in pain and none of it would move. No matter how hard he tried to lift his arm up to shield his eyes, it would not budge. A cold metallic object was placed directly no his forehead. Somewhere through all the pain there was the smallest source of relief.</p>

<p>That relief slowly but surely spread from his forehead to other parts of his face. Soon, it wasn’t such a burden to open his eyes. Within a few more minutes he coughed feeling his body convulsing almost as if he was drowning. Black particles flew from his mouth as he steadied his breathing. His neck started to relax allowing him to move his head from side to side. He shifted his head only to feel a smooth hand force his head back into place. Suddenly his stomach starting twisting and turning causing him to curl in a different kind of uncomfortable pain that reminded him he was indeed alive.</p>

<p>Chelsen had become very aware of how flaky his skin was and when he was finally given the chance to look down, there was no evidence that he had a black-spreading bruise at all. His skin looked awful, but he retained the figure of any normal Umana again. For the first time in a couple of days, Chelsen’s shoulders completely relaxed without the weight of death upon him.</p>

<hr />

<p>Sunlight hit Chelsen’s face causing him to instinctively move his hand up as a shield. His whole arm creaked with a soreness that he had never known before. He took a moment to interpret all the knew feelings that were flooding his brain. It was hard to make sense of the keen awareness he now had. Before becoming sick, Chelsen had always been aware of his surroundings but something had changed. First he noticed that he could feel every part of his body. Each toe was aligned at a specific angle, his right arm was splayed out with his wrist slightly bent down. Dirt made contact with very specific points of his body. Somehow, Chelsen felt as if he could draw a perfect picture of how he was laid out on the ground without having seen what he looked like. Even his face, which he was obviously unable to see at the current moment was clear as day to himself. Without touching his own face, he could feel every little bump and curve.</p>

<p>Slowly rising up off his back he noticed his hearing was different. The clearing around him was almost silent aside from the harsh wind that was blowing across wherever he was. The reflective beings he had seen before were a few steps away interacting with weird metallic and transparent panels. A giant hunk of smooth metal pointed out of a small crater in the distance. Chelsen tried to take in his surroundings are was able to sense a cliff’s edge not too far east of where he was. Tracing the cliff’s edge with his mind, he recognized the shape. They were sitting on Volida’s Peak!</p>

<p>One of the beings started walking towards Chelsen. With each step it took a loud crack shot off in his head. He winced at the sensation. Eventually the being placed its spherical fingertips on his head. A transparent tool exploded with colors Chelsen had never seen before. His eyes started to water from being bombarded with all the bright colors of the tool.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the being’s spherical fingertips warmed up. The hypersensitivity of everything around Chelsen dulled down. The world quieted down into a calming silence allowing him to focus his thoughts yet again.</p>

<p>“What are you doing to me?” Chelsen asked. The fingertips got much hotter. “Ow, that hurts!” yelled Chelsen. He pushed the hand off his head. “Who are you?” The figure stood there reflecting all light off its silhouette. Seeing such a faceless and alien creature was already deeply disturbing enough. Being touched by one did not help the panic starting to rise up from Chelsen’s stomach. Afraid to move, Chelsen observed the being interact with its tool as it made gestures that somehow interacted with all the colors.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of waiting, the being moved closer to Chelsen. “Are you ready to talk?” he asked. The being did not respond. Whatever this creature was, it appeared to approach very cautiously. “What, you want to touch my head again?” No response was uttered. The being continued to move closer to Chelsen. Unsure of what to do, he waited. Eventually the fingertips lightly touched the side of his head and warmed up again. “Are you happy?” Chelsen asked.</p>

<p>“Are you happy?” he heard his voice echo. Chelsen’s eyes scanned the clearing unable to see anyone else.</p>

<p>“Did you say that?” Chelsen looked directly at the being.</p>

<p>“Did you say that?” his voice echoed again.</p>

<p>“Great, I’m hearing voices in my head now…” Chelsen muttered.</p>

<p>Without warning, lots of sounds flooded Chelsen’s head. Random memories resurfaced with all the scents and sounds and sights clearly coming back. It was almost as if he was watching parts of his life pass before his eyes.</p>

<p>Stunned by all the memories, Chelsen sat where he was for a couple of minutes before it all stopped and a small voice appeared. “Comp… com… can… tan… tana…” the voice droned on and on. Most of what it was saying was complete nonsense. Slowly, as minutes passed by, it got closer to forming words. “Comp… Comptana… Compute. Computing. Computing Umana… Computing Umana Language Complete.”</p>
