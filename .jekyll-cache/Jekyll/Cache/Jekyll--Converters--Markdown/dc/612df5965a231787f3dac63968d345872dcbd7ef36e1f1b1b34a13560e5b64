I"*<p>Red energy emanated from the artifact Lin held in their hand. The metal-like object was covered in what Lin suspected was an ancient language. An indented line divided the spherical object in half. Without the proper lighting, it was nearly impossible to see the smallest holes equidistantly spread across the line. Each hole held a button receded even farther into the device.</p>

<p>Steadily guiding the pick Lin gently tried to push one of the impossibly small buttons further into the object. The door opened behind Lin causing them to jerk their arm snapping the pick’s head and wedging it into the device. “Damn it,” Lin muttered to themselves as they quickly shoved the device into a bag sitting on their lap. They turned around to the door only to see Lorcan standing with his hands on his hips.</p>

<p>“The council meeting is only minutes away! Are you not coming?” Lorcan gestured for Lin to leave his house and join him.</p>

<p>Lin laid back in their chair and stared at the ceiling. “What do you want Lorcan? I know you are not concerned for me,” Lin stated as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>“Oh please, I care about all the citizens of Saol which is why I want to help you with your duty to the people,” Lorcan explained as he started heading toward the council’s building leaving Lin’s home.</p>

<p>The sun dial on the ceiling showed it was almost midday. Lorcan was right about one thing, thought Lin. It was most certainty time to meet. They would be late if they didn’t leave know. Lin wasn’t wild about Lorcan’s new, cold kindness but they had no choice.</p>

<p>With their bag on their shoulder and the front door closed, Lin traveled toward the council’s building at the center of town. Townsfolk rustled around and merchants shouted into the streets trying to get anyone to look at their wares. Every part of the street that didn’t lead into someone’s house was packed with merchants and their stands providing an assortment of goods from jewelry to delicious delicacies brought all the way from Modara.</p>

<p>Unable to resist, Lin quickly approached their favorite merchant and purchased a rare and delicious assortment of Modarian mushrooms. The taste reminded them of their childhood growing up in Modara’s canyons on the other side of the continent.
With no time to spare Lin was the last one to make it to the council meeting with many of them looking impatient. As soon as Lin sat down Lorcan opened his mouth. “I would like to start today’s agenda with the new expansion project headed by Lin,” Lorcan announced.</p>

<p>“Who put you in charge, Lorcan?” A woman of the council from the other side of the table gave Lorcan a rather inquisitive look. “As I recall you are not head of council: I am.” She gave Lorcan a dirty look.</p>

<p>“Fine, what would you like to talk about first,” Lorcan asked impatiently. His face was red with anger.</p>

<p>“Remember that we are a council Lorcan, not a dictatorship. We all should agree on how we should proceed. All who want to pursue this topic raise your hand.” As the lady spoke every council member raised their hands. Lin was the last to join in afraid of what Lorcan had planned.</p>

<p>“Why thank you council. Now as I was saying we need to look at our new expansion project for the town of Saol.” Lorcan continued to the front of the room where a map of Saol was spread out on the wall. “We all know the town simply cannot accommodate all the new merchants who want to stay for we are a very prosperous trading hub.”
“Objection!” Another council member stood up. “Lorcan, we have said this many times before and we will say it again. This town hosts more than just merchants! The Schools of Reasoning are also struggling to house all their students. Please make your selfish ambitions less obvious or leave the council!” With his final words the council member sat back down.</p>

<p>“I hear you, my apologies.” Lorcan bowed toward the council member who objected. “All of Saol is currently in a housing crisis. I know we proposed and approved to start expanding west towards the Last Stand Ruins, but I am concerned for multiple reasons.” Lorcan pointed towards the area just west of the town of Saol. “Firstly, this landmark is known to be haunted. I mean it is called ‘Last Stand Ruins’! No one will want to live in a town that was obviously cursed before.”</p>

<p>The head of the council interrupted again. “Lorcan, we have already discussed this issue. The majority of us believe this superstition will pass with time. The land is ideal to expand housing which is why we are proceeding in this direction.” She looked even more irritated as Lorcan interrupted her.</p>

<p>“It is not a superstition! Lin can vouch for me. Are there not still skeletal remains of Umana in those very ruins?” Lorcan looked towards Lin.</p>

<p>“Um, yes there are. We are in the process right now of removing th-” Lin tried to finish the thought but Lorcan interrupted again.</p>

<p>“See! Umana died on this land and we still haven’t the faintest idea why! But fine, if you want to ignore this fact, let me propose another issue with this project.” Lorcan bent over the council table with both hands planted firmly on the edge. “Lin, you have repeatedly delayed this project which is costing us time and resources. Additionally, you have seemed more irritable every day, and you are even late to council meetings unless I remind you. Why is it taking you so long to complete the most basic of tasks?” Lorcan stared at Lin with a piercing gaze.</p>

<p>“What are you insinuating Lorcan? There are few people more qualified than I am to complete this project.” Lin didn’t break eye contact.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it odd that you too have spent much time at Last Stand Ruins planning this development project, and now you have this major change in attitude?” Lorcan smiled.
The rest of the council muttered to themselves. Lin looked around at their worried faces. With a deep breath, Lin explained. “Yes, this project has been more challenging than we previously thought. I have had some complications I never saw coming. That definitely adds to my stress in top of your consistent interogations!”</p>

<p>Before Lin could continue Lorcan interjected. “What kind of complications?”</p>

<p>Sweat beaded down Lin’s forehead. They didn’t want to tell them of the underground bunker hidden in the Last Stand Ruin’s well that was discovered only sixteen days before. Technology that had never been seen lay in that bunker, and Lin was terrified to know what Lorcan would do with the mysterious technology.</p>

<p>Even Lin wasn’t sure what to make of the unusual situation. Their hand reached  down to their bag making sure the artifact was still in their possession. Something much larger was at play and Lin was sure Lorcan suspected them of something. “The materials in each building are built much stronger than we expected. It may be a ruin but whoever lived there before were very good at building unbreakable structures.” This was not a lie, but Lin knew this most certainly was not the answer Lorcan was looking for.
“Enough!” The head of the council raised her first into the air. “This matter is closed. The project will proceed as we all agreed upon unless someone has a reasonable objection.”</p>

<hr />

<p>As the council meeting adjourned Lin made sure to not stick around. Lorcan, unable to cut off Lin before they exited, decided to keep talking to council members about the housing expansion project.</p>

<p>As Lin exited the building the full view of Saol was revealed. The council’s building sat atop the largest hill in Saol overlooking the entire town. Massive ships were docking and undocking, carts busily raced through the center street of town, and Umana roamed all the streets in search of goods or running errands. Many of the houses were carved into the sides of hills or stood as stone structures built from the recycled materials of previously carved out buildings. Further away from the hills stood very wide wooden houses dividing the merchant district from the housing district being able to hold as many as fifty visitors in one building.</p>

<p>Turning around, Lin headed north towards the back of the council’s building. Sitting north of town on the outskirts were three massive stone campuses that housed all the Schools of Reasoning. Each stone campus was devoted to one school. The oldest, the School of Nature, was easily distinguishable as it was covered in greenery. The School of Nature was by far the most confusing place to navigate out of all of Saol. The School of Science was in-between the two other schools, more refined and sensible than the School of Nature, but lacked the sheer rigidity and geometric expression of the School of Technology.</p>

<p>It took an hour for Lin to walk to the School of Technology and find the correct lab room that was specifically concerned with locking mechanisms. The lab was practically empty with everything put neatly away behind glass cabinets. Each cabinet was closed off with a different type of lock. It was take a master thief to be able to steal anything from this room as this was the place where students developed the latest and greatest new locking mechanisms. Most of the locks hadn’t been widely adopted by the general public of Soal, more or less any village outside of Saol.</p>

<p>Tables lined the edges of the room below the cabinets with one lone center table sitting at waist level. A student stood next to the center table fiddling with a very odd contraption Lin had never seen before.</p>

<p>“What do you know about locks,” Lin asked the student.</p>

<p>“Lots! You need to break into something?” The student smiled offering his hand to shake. Although the two did not know each other intimately, they had seen in each other in passing. Lin constantly consulted the Schools of Reasoning for help in council projects, so their face was not a new one.</p>

<p>Lin reached out and shook hands. “Yeah, I have a weird contraption that  I drew schematics for. I was hoping you would be able to help me open it.” Lin took out sketches of the device that were stored in their bag. They didn’t want to show the actual device. Lin was sure the moment they revealed this new technology the School of Technology would want to take possession of it, and Lin was hesitant to let anyone know of this discovery. “I’m Lin, by the way.”</p>

<p>“Nice to meet you Lin. My name is Fig. Let’s see what we can do about your contraption.” Fig took Lin’s sketches and laid them out across the table started taking notes.</p>
