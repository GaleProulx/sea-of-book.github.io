I".<p>Fade gazed out the window into the distant, red-hued fog masking the outside world. Her finger silently traced the imperfections of the metallic desk roughed up by countless students before her. So many names desperately scrapped into eternal existence more out of desperation than anything else.</p>

<p>“Alrighty, who is ready for class today?” Behind the old professor was a metallic silver plate spanning most of the back wall. “Great response, I see most of you ready to learn history,” he joked. Not single student was even attempting to look engaged. We always started out this way. Pretending like we weren’t excited for his next lesson. “Okay, before we start just get it out. What are you thinking? Say anything.” His burly white mustache bounced in an animated way when he talked almost as if it was alive. The mustache even looked like it had a breathing rhythm that matched the professors heavy snorting which always felt loud enough to shake the old tin box they called a classroom.</p>

<p>“It’s 8AM and we are in a classroom to learn history… why does this have to happen?” A girl, wearing more copper accent in her jewelry than the walls around her, muttered the question to herself more than to the professor.</p>

<p>“Wow, I really thought this would be about something completely different. Maybe drama, or something I did wrong. Guess I am not one to question it. Let’s go with the question! Why?” The professor picked up a marker and drew the word “why” with big, sharp corners. “Hope the studious one, I couldn’t have asked a better question. Does anybody know the answer? Keep in mind I’m implying there is an answer.” He put one hand behind his back as he searched for someone to raise a hand.</p>

<p>“Tradition,” a small boy squeaked up front. The boy was indeed a student despite being younger than anyone else in the room. Somehow, he always seemed to have the answers. Most students believed that little boy was actually an old man trapped inside a young persons body.</p>

<p>“Haha, Gil you always seem to have the answers, don’t you?” The professor added “tradition” to the metallic plate. “Come on people, some of you must have something to say?” No one moved. “Okay fine, you got me. Gil is right, tradition is the answer. Us adults were taught this same material and we feel the need to pass it on to you. Rather than follow other teachers’ style, I let you explore the history you are interested in. I would go on about how this stuff is actually more important than you think, but I guess trying to manipulate your motives will only make you hate the subject more. Let’s move on then and explore. Group up!”</p>

<p>As it happened every single class, students moved the desks one next to another forming long benches surrounding the professors desk. Naturally the movement and heavy lifting made some students much more alert. By the time all the desks were in a “U” formation ready to hear story-telling, the professor had erased the giant “why” and sketched a basic diagram of the cities of Steel called “Divisions.” A single “X” was placed at the Front Division.</p>

<p>“How about…” the professor trailed off contemplating who would be his next victim for storytelling. “Fade! I don’t think I’ve ever seen you up here. Please join me.”</p>

<p>Everyone stared at Fade. No one really knew anything about her. Her parents never accompanied her to or from school. Every day it seemed like she left in a different direction to get home. She was a complete mystery until now, walking up to the spotlight at the front of the classroom.</p>

<p>“Picture that you are here.” The professor pointed toward the “X” on the metallic plate. “There is only one difference: you are actually standing in that very spot right when the First Division is about to be completed over five hundred years ago. What do you see as you gaze out to that First Division?” His mustache moved ecstatically as his breathing became slightly more frequent.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I imagine the bridge hasn’t been built yet. I’m just looking at a mostly flat plate supported by two massive pillars. Only gondolas connect the Front Division to the First.” Fade looked around only to see everyone intently staring at her. It appeared the class was much more interested in her than the story. She never talked this much.</p>

<p>“Excellent, excellent, excellent!” The professor lazily sat on his desk. “What would you like to explore?” His hand waived to the crude drawing.</p>

<p>Fade took a moment. What did she want to find out? Most of this part of history was concerned with expansion. Everything had to be big to accommodate a growing population, hence why the First of the Five Divisions was by far the biggest to be built. Now that she thought about it, she didn’t know what else was different about the First Division to every other one. “I want to know what is different. Why are the pillars so much larger?”</p>

<p>The professor shot up from the desk, grabbed a marker, and dashed to the metallic back-plate. “Interesting question indeed? Would you like to transport to the side of the pillar?”</p>

<p>Fade turned her head slightly sideways with screwed up eyebrows. “How would I stand on the side of the pillar?”</p>

<p>Quickly the professor flicked off the cap of the marker. “It seems you have not taken the time to really look at the landscape you live on.” The marker started flying across the metallic board drawing the small details of the massive supporting pillar. “Naturally you all know the main purpose of the First Division pillars: keep the city far, far off the ground.” Suddenly the bottom of the drawing was filled with a rugged landscape. “You see, after the Front Division was built, our civilization realized how hard it was to just defend one gate from the dangers of the world. How would we defend ourselves if we expanded our cliff-side civilization on land? It was simple, stop building on land. Make the Front Division a choke-point to the rest of society.” In a side view perspective, a small city labeled “Front Division” was placed on the edge of a cliff with the aforementioned gates. Then the city labeled “First Division” was placed in mid air disjointed from the Front Division. Only gondolas connected the two cities. Connecting the First Division to the ground were the two giant pillars.</p>

<p>“To answer your first question, those pillars are massive because we simply didn’t have the engineering skills to make anything smaller. Creating a city in the sky is no easy feat. The First Division is an example of ancient engineering scaled to massive proportions.” Giant buildings that define today’s skyline appeared. Anyone who had traveled knew that the First Division was the biggest by far, and was also closest to the ground.</p>

<p>“To answer your second question, Fade, you can stand next to these pillars because scaffolding is still attached to these pillars, even today.” Tiny platforms appeared next to the pillar. “While these pillars are mostly a combination of concrete and metal, other things were added on such as scientific probes. Thus, these pillars serve a dual purpose of supporting the First Division from collapsing and teaching future engineers the dangers of massive scaling.” The professor’s marker squeaked as the drawing added the Second Division to scale. Yet another city was drawn floating in the air, but this time much higher and with only one pillar.</p>

<p>Class continued as the mist outside turned from red-hued to white. Eventually the bell rang dismissing class and interrupting a very interesting story the professor was telling about the collapse of one of the first skyscrapers ever built.</p>

<p>“Please remember to to put your desks back into position! Also Hope, my student, I still need last weeks assignment from you!” Hope gave the professor a dirty look while he turned to Fade. “Also Fade, please don’t leave quite yet. I have to ask you something.” Students filed out of the front door as Fade leaned against the back wall, arms crossed.</p>

<p>“Professor, whatever you think I did wrong I swear I wasn’t aware. I have never-“ the professor held up his hand silencing Fade. She looked down.</p>

<p>“Relax Fade, I am not here to criticize you.” The professor was in the middle of cleaning the metallic board of his massive drawing. “If you would allow it, please let me ask you one question.”</p>

<p>Fade closed her eyes taking a deep breath. She really did like this professor. Despite his cliche looks and old-timey accent, he was surprisingly interesting. He just understood students unlike most teachers. “Sure, just make it quick if you can. I have to run to my next class.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” he replied. “As I said, it’s just one question.” He cleared his throat. “What’s your hobby?”</p>

<p>Fade screwed up her face. She was held back just so the professor could ask her what her hobby was? Maybe he was didn’t get young people. This conversation was starting to make Fade uncomfortable. “Seriously? Reading, I guess?”</p>

<p>The professor took out a notebook and a pen. “Are you sure? That seems pretty generic, especially for someone like you.” He started scribbling notes.</p>

<p>Fade started lifting up her backpack to make a quick escape if need be. The window behind her was half open which would make for one easy leap to escape. Alternatively, the top hatch of the classroom was also open for some reason. The only way to easily reach it was by climbing the ladder outside. Luckily, Fade could easily take a jumping step off a desk and pull herself up through the hole with little difficulty. Hopefully that wouldn’t be necessary. Fade brought her gaze back to the professor who was looking down at his notebook madly scribbling away. “Sorry if you don’t like the response. I really do enjoy reading.” It wasn’t a complete lie. Fade did enjoy reading, but it wasn’t her favorite hobby. She also didn’t read fiction, but rather blueprints. Despite all these caveats, it was still technically true! Besides, she shouldn’t have to justify herself for such a bizarre and creepy question.</p>

<p>“Fair enough. I’m disappointed, I really thought you would be different.” He started standing up and approaching Fade. So many red flags went off in her head. She did not want to get close to this pervert. She knew exactly what his “deal” was after all. “Mind if I close that window? It has started raining,” he pointed out.</p>

<p>Sure enough raindrops appeared on the window and on the ground below the top hatch revealed the sky. Fade relaxed and moved away from the open window. He was still weird, but she was really hoping it was just a socially awkward old man and not something much darker. Regardless, she wasn’t taking any more chances being alone with him. “Is that all?” Her hand was already on the front door.</p>

<p>“Yes yes, you may go. I apologize for keeping you so long. Have a nice day Fade. Please stay safe.” He struggled to close the rusted window as Fade slipped through the front door and put on her rain jacket. The way he struggled to close that window, hopefully Fade could fight him off if he ever did something disturbing. Letting herself have a moment to shake off the uncomfortable situation, Fade closed her eyes and let the rain hit her face. <em>What a way to start the morning?</em> she thought. As she walked away from the classroom building she heard a slam of the top hatch but could have sworn she didn’t hear anyone open the front door to use the ladder.</p>
