<p>Gale Proulx, that’s who! I’m a recent Data Analytics graduate from Champlain College. Unfortunately, my day job being a Data Scientist doesn’t give me nearly as many opportunities as I want to creatively write, so this is my outlet. (What? I know I picked the wrong major…)</p>

<p>Onwards to the next question!</p>

<h1 id="what-is-this-website">What is this website?</h1>

<p>As mentioned before, you will be find creative work in various genres as well as pieces still being worked on, such as my book Unintentional Calamity (compendium found <a href="https://galeproulx.gitbook.io/the-unintentional-calamity">here</a>).</p>

<p>If you are referring to the name of the website, there is a funny story behind it. I decided to make this website on a whim and I asked my friend what I should name it. He said I had to make the website name a pun: no other rules. We compromised on “Sea of Book” as a silly name for what is essentially a book (or collection) of my creative fiction writing. Yes, the grammar of the website title is purposefully atrocious.</p>

<h1 id="can-i-publish-your-work-on-this-website-elsewhere">Can I publish your work on this website elsewhere?</h1>

<p>Ask first! I’m not opposed to the idea, but you need my explicit permission. Feel free to email me at galeproulx@gmail.com with any questions. I promise I won’t bite (hard)!</p>

<h1 id="is-there-any-space-for-other-writers">Is there any space for other writers?</h1>

<p>Yes! I wouldn’t mind publishing other people’s work on this website. You would still get credit and have full rights to your piece. In other words, if you wanted to modify or remove your piece, you could! Collaboration is a beautiful thing, and I don’t want the publishing space to be what stops a good story from being read.</p>
