I"û<p>The pocket watch resting in Fadeâ€™s hand read 9:40AM. If she was going to make it to her next class she had to book it. With a flick of the wrist she snapped he pocket watch shut and clipped the chain to her belt. On a misty day like today, Fade could take a shortcut. The Fifth Division, the one she was currently standing on, was built so high up it was often covered by the clouds. Sometimes they got a nice view of the mountain range below, but most of the time it was pure fog. This also meant they got some vicious weather. Some days, the wind would be so bad that citizens are encouraged to take all covered pathways to and from work. Only a careless person would jump from building to building to try to make it on time to their next destination.</p>
