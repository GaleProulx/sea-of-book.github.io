I"<p>The energy of a bunch of sleepy teenagers filled the air of the poorly lit classroom. Wind howled as it crashed upon the metal walls making the small building occasionally shutter stirring even the most tired students awake.</p>

<p>Fade was not one of those tired students. In fact, she was almost out of breath. It had only been two minutes before class when she exited the train station. The fact that she made it before the teacher started talking non-stop was a miracle.</p>

<p>Her feet sat upon the ancient wooden desk with the hard heel of her boot slowly grinding away the already scratched surface. She couldn’t sit still. After all that running her feet needed to keep moving.</p>

<p>The window next to her showed the red-hued sky promising that the sun would once again rise to fill the room with light. The tops of some mountains were barely visible from the window when a cloud wasn’t passing by. She longed to explore the great valley below where supposed terrible beasts lay waiting to strike anyone stupid enough to clamber down to the ground. Of course, that was the tale. If her suspicions were correct, all that fear mongering is for a completely different purpose than protecting the “poor unintelligent people” from their own curiosity.</p>

<p>“Attention class!” professor Fog commanded up at the front of the classroom. He had already uncapped a marker ready to write on the metallic board. Not a single student moved. Fog sighed while waving his hands emphatically. “Alright, I get it. Folks your age aren’t supposed to be up this early. Let’s get up! You know what to do.”</p>

<p>Slowly, like zombies, each student rose from their desk and started dragging it towards the edges of room leaving a nice clearing. Professor Fog always liked to have a stage. Anyone accidentally walking into the classroom could easily be forgiven for thinking they had walked into a theater class. Somehow, through the appreciation of most students, it was a history class. Every part of history taught through role-playing rather than dry text on an even drier page.</p>

<p>Fade hardly had to move. Her desk was already in the corner. After saying goodbye to the fantastic view she lazily got up and hopped across the top of each desk to the center. When the scrambling around was finished, each student took their seat.</p>

<p>“Much appreciated students,” Fog yelled over the sound of shuffling feet as everyone got situated. “Now we can get on to today’s lesson. Does anyone remember what we talked about last time?” No one moved. “Really folks?” One student looked like she wanted to raise her hand but resisted the urge. Fog did not notice. “Okay now this is really bumming me out. Are my lessons that unbearable?”</p>

<p>As Fog turned his attention to Fade she pointed at small student just about ready to burst with the answer. He turned around and laughed. “Gil! Sorry, I didn’t see you there. Please do tell us what we did.”</p>

<p>With all the force in her lungs she spat out at light speed, “we talked about some of the first construction of the Great Gate and the five pillars and all the materials used to hold the structure completely still so it wouldn’t topple over like all the great engineers could have sworn-“ Gil took a quick breath to keep going, “was going to happen and how the council decided to go ahead with the plans and how nothing terrible has happened ever since!” The stupidest grin appeared on her face. She was by far the youngest in the class, about twelve, so anytime she could outdo her peers was a</p>
