Unfortunately, Chelsen’s pace was much slower due to the unbelievable darkness that filled the forest and the increasing effort it took just to breath. He knew the infection was spreading at a fairly fast pace as his shoulder was now showing the same bruising his forehead. Sunrise had hit when Chelsen was approaching Volida’s Peak. By now the infection was starting to spread fairly deep into the forest. He guessed it would only be a few days before the black dust had reached Iris. It was hard to imagine there was anything left of Frelia at this point.</p>
