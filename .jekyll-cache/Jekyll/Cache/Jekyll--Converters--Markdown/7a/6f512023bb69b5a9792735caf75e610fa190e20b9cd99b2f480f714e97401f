I"ò<p>Whiskey clinks in my glass as I turn it delicately with my wrist. Memories flash of all the different people Iâ€™ve killed with this hand. A simple flick of the wrist can do a lot. A girl at a birthday party not expecting a hidden blade to cut through her throat in front of all her friends at the bar. Making a simple twist of someone elseâ€™s hand forcing them off a cliff. Tossing a needle into an old manâ€™s artery as he tried to rush for a phone. All with a simple flick of the wrist.</p>
