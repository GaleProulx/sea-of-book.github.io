I"º<p>The pocket watch resting in Fadeâ€™s hand read 9:40AM. If she was going to make it to her next class she had to book it. With a flick of the wrist she snapped he pocket watch shut and clipped the chain to her belt. On a misty day like today, Fade could take a shortcut. The Fifth Division, the one she was currently standing on, was built so high up it was often covered by the clouds. Sometimes they got a nice view of the mountain range below, but most of the time it was pure fog. This also meant they got some vicious weather. Some days, the wind would be so bad that citizens are encouraged to take all covered pathways to and from work. Only a careless person would jump from building to building to try to make it on time to their next destination.</p>

<p>Fade took a running start at the wall in front of her and grabbed onto a protruding pipe. She climbed up it and within a minute she was standing on top of the two story building looking down at the history classroom that was nearly covered in fog. This wasnâ€™t the first time she took this shortcut, and from her tendency to be late she figured it wouldnâ€™t be her last either. Turning around, she broke out to a full on sprint jumping from building to building causing a ruckus of bending metal rooftops echoing after every footstep. If the town wasnâ€™t awake before, it most certainly was now.</p>

<hr />

<p>With no time to spare, Fade made it to her electrical engineering class right as the professor was closing the door. Unlike her history class, this professor had an uncanny ability to make time fall dead out of the air. While Fade was not necessarily opposed to the idea of learning about circuits and ohms, she always dreaded another hour and a half spent with the constant drone of an adult going through the motions without any enthusiasm whatsoever.</p>

<p>When class finally ended Fade was the first to slip out of the classroom, running into an ally and climb on the nearest roof. The fog had lifted and she was not about to miss out on the spectacular view that so rarely showed. As with every week, Fadeâ€™s first two classes were followed by a break for lunch which meant she had more time to run out to the edge of the Fifth Division. Luckily, the education district was near the edge of the division already, making it a short distance to travel. By running on rooftops and avoiding street traffic, her trip would be even shorter.</p>

<p>Red faced and sweaty palmed, Fade made it to the edge of the division and looked out. Mountains below looked as though they swayed in the wind as shadows from clouds rolled by. The one lake located just a mile ahead blinded anyone who dared looked into it. Fade decided to sit down and make herself comfortable as she scanned the landscape.</p>

<p>â€œLooks nice, doesnâ€™t it?â€ The voice originated from behind Fade on the roof. Every muscle in her body stiffened. It was probably a security guard that had bothered to follow her. Most guards didnâ€™t want to chase a kid running across roofs, but this one must have been having a bad day. â€œToo bad this view isnâ€™t great.â€ Every syllable was relaxed and deep as it rolled out of their mouth. Whatever guard this was seemed unnaturally calm. A disturbing calm like you would have knowing that you were about to kick a kid off a building.</p>

<p>Without hesitation Fade rolled backwards and swept her feet across the roof causing the person behind her to jump back. He most certainly didnâ€™t look like a guard. Jet black hair, baggy pants, and dog tags. <em>Who the hell wears dog tags?</em> Fade questioned. Not waiting for an explanation, Fade bolted down the roof to a pipe attached to the side of the building. The man followed, keeping his distance. As Fade slipped down the pipe he gracefully stepped off the building and grabbed a hold of the pipe. Deciding to take a chance, Fade let go early and rolled on the ground miscalculating how much momentum she was carrying. The resulting mistake forced her to roll much further than anticipated straight into an empty dumpster that closed upon her messy entrance.</p>

<p>The man sighed as he slipped down the pipe, let go and rolled and jumped onto the dumpster. Fade was trapped, desperately trying to lift his heavy body off the lid. â€œAre you done? I just want to talk. Youâ€™re not in any trouble.â€ A large thud hit the dumpster lid as the man lazily plopped himself on the lid.</p>

<p>â€œWhat do you want?â€ Fadeâ€™s voice echoed as she spoke. â€œAre you a security guard?â€ She could hear how small her voice sounded.</p>

<p>â€œDo I look like a security guard? Honestly, Iâ€™m kind of offended.â€ He slipped of the dumpster lid and lifted it up to reveal a disheveled Fade poking her head out. As soon as the light hit her face she ducked back into the shadow unable to see. â€œThe nameâ€™s Toan. Nice to meet you Fade.â€ He seemed to take no notice of Fadeâ€™s shocked face as he said this. â€œDonâ€™t worry, we all know who you are. Weâ€™ve had our eyes on you for a while.â€ He offered a hand to pull her out of the dumpster.</p>

<p>Begrudgingly, Fade accepted the help. â€œAlright Toan. Assuming you arenâ€™t a random creep, Iâ€™ll play along. Why are you stalking me?â€ They were both leaning against opposite walls of the ally. Fade quickly surveyed the area for quick exits. Unfortunately, it appeared her options were limited.</p>

<p>â€œYou hurt me so, Fade. I am not here to hurt you. In any case, if you do wish to run I would recommend his way.â€ He pointed towards a slightly opened window leading into the building she was leaning on, accompanied by a painfully obvious wink. â€œWe are looking for new recruits. You seem to have the qualification.â€ His eyes shone hopeful. For what, Fade wasnâ€™t sure.</p>

<p>â€œNew recruit for what?â€ As the words came out of her mouth, Toanâ€™s smile faded into a annoyed eyebrow twitch. â€œWhat? Did I say the wrong thing to you too?â€ With no warning, Toan facepalmed and groaned muttering far too many swears at once for Fade to pick out.</p>

<p>â€œThe old man didnâ€™t tell you, did he? Lazy son of aâ€¦â€ Toan trailed off with more incomprehensible sentences. <em>Great, another crazy personâ€¦</em> Fade concluded. Just as she had done with her professor this morning, Fade slowly started inching towards the window that would lead her to freedom. â€œWait! Iâ€™m sorry. Your professor this morning was supposed to tell you about us. Guess the senile old man decided to quiz you instead. He was never in favor of letting you in.â€ He looked totally defeated, obviously having failed to present himself the way he had imagined. â€œDo you want to be a Manipulator?â€</p>

<p>A silence fell over the alley as the words disappeared. Fade wasnâ€™t sure what a Manipulator was. The words had never been spoken to her. This confusion reflected on her face as she asked, â€œa what now?â€</p>

<p>â€œManipulator! You know, the people who fix everything so this damned division magically stays together.â€ The information only made Fade looked more confused. â€œWhat? You never noticed? Power outages that are almost instantly fixed. Mini-quakes that never last more than a second. You canâ€™t possibly believe thatâ€™s all military exercises and experimental accidents!â€ Toan stared into Fadeâ€™s eyes with a fierce gaze passionately trying to make Fade understand by sheer willpower alone.</p>

<p>With those final words Fade lept for the window. As she ran through the abandoned floor she didnâ€™t hear any footsteps following. Whatever this man thought he was, it was not sane.</p>
