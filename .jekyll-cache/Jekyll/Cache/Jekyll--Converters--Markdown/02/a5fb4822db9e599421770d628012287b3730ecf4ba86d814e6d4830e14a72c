I"Õ#<p>The energy of a bunch of sleepy teenagers filled the air of the poorly lit classroom. Wind howled as it crashed upon the metal walls making the small building occasionally shutter stirring even the most tired students awake.</p>

<p>Fade was not one of those tired students. In fact, she was almost out of breath. It had only been two minutes before class when she exited the train station. The fact that she made it before the teacher started talking non-stop was a miracle.</p>

<p>Her feet sat upon the ancient wooden desk with the hard heel of her boot slowly grinding away the already scratched surface. She couldnâ€™t sit still. After all that running her feet needed to keep moving.</p>

<p>The window next to her showed the red-hued sky promising that the sun would once again rise to fill the room with light. The tops of some mountains were barely visible from the window when a cloud wasnâ€™t passing by. She longed to explore the great valley below where supposed terrible beasts lay waiting to strike anyone stupid enough to clamber down to the ground. Of course, that was the tale. If her suspicions were correct, all that fear mongering is for a completely different purpose than protecting the â€œpoor unintelligent peopleâ€ from their own curiosity.</p>

<p>â€œAttention class!â€ professor Fog commanded up at the front of the classroom. He had already uncapped a marker ready to write on the metallic board. Not a single student moved. Fog sighed while waving his hands emphatically. â€œAlright, I get it. Folks your age arenâ€™t supposed to be up this early. Letâ€™s get up! You know what to do.â€</p>

<p>Slowly, like zombies, each student rose from their desk and started dragging it towards the edges of room leaving a nice clearing. Professor Fog always liked to have a stage. Anyone accidentally walking into the classroom could easily be forgiven for thinking they had walked into a theater class. Somehow, through the appreciation of most students, it was a history class. Every part of history taught through role-playing rather than dry text on an even drier page.</p>

<p>Fade hardly had to move. Her desk was already in the corner. After saying goodbye to the fantastic view she lazily got up and hopped across the top of each desk to the center. When the scrambling around was finished, each student took their seat.</p>

<p>â€œMuch appreciated students,â€ Fog yelled over the sound of shuffling feet as everyone got situated. â€œNow we can get on to todayâ€™s lesson. Does anyone remember what we talked about last time?â€ No one moved. â€œReally folks?â€ One student looked like she wanted to raise her hand but resisted the urge. Fog did not notice. â€œOkay now this is really bumming me out. Are my lessons that unbearable?â€</p>

<p>As Fog turned his attention to Fade she pointed at small student just about ready to burst with the answer. He turned around and laughed. â€œGil! Sorry, I didnâ€™t see you there. Please do tell us what we did.â€</p>

<p>With all the force in her lungs she spat out at light speed, â€œwe talked about some of the first construction of the Great Gate and the five pillars and all the materials used to hold the structure completely still so it wouldnâ€™t topple over like all the great engineers could have sworn-â€œ Gil took a quick breath to keep going, â€œwas going to happen and how the council decided to go ahead with the plans and how nothing terrible has happened ever since!â€ The stupidest grin appeared on her face. She was by far the youngest in the class, about twelve, so anytime she could outdo her peers was a fantastic prospect for her.</p>

<p>Most of the class stayed unphased by the usual burst of energy that is Gil as professor Fog laughed yet again matching her energy. â€œSee class,â€ Fog continued, â€œthere is such a thing as enthusiasm. Donâ€™t get old and forgot that!â€ Playing on their fears, most students became more attentive almost immediately. â€œNow who would like to explore history today?â€</p>

<p>Fadeâ€™s hands started to sweat. While she did enjoy class, she hated the spotlight. Somehow, role-playing in front of the whole class was not a very enticing prospect.</p>

<p>â€œAnyone want to volunteer?â€ Fog asked. Gil raised her hand with her usual levels of freak enthusiasm. Fog noticed. â€œSorry Gil, someone else needs to come up on stage every once in a while.â€</p>

<p>When no one else volunteered Fog took out a piece of paper from the front pocket of his collared shirt. A twenty sided dice was retrieved from his pants pocket. Rolling the dice onto the floor across the stage, the number on top showed 15. â€œLet me see now,â€ Fog grumbled to himself. â€œAh, Gilâ€™s number. Sorry! Letâ€™s try again.â€</p>

<p>Gil looked absolutely destroyed from the second rejection in a row. Fade would have felt bad if she wasnâ€™t so focused on the second roll. It landed on a 1. Of course. Why wouldnâ€™t it land on her number?</p>

<p>Fog muttered to himself as he went down the sheet of paper. Fade already knew her fate. She briefly considered jumping off the desk and straight to the open hatch at the top of the classroom. No one would be able to catch her, although her parents would be quite upset to learn she immediately deserted the classroom because she was called upon in class.</p>

<p>â€œFade!â€ Fog announced excitedly. â€œIt looks like it is your turn today!â€ Folding the paper back into his front pocket he grabbed the marker completely forgetting to retrieve the die. Fade looked at the one desperately hoping she wouldnâ€™t trip on it making herself look like an even bigger fool than she felt she was.</p>

<p>Turning her attention to the front of the classroom, Fog had already drawn a rather detailed depiction of their city. A massive, singular pillar held up an unbelievably wide platform that was the Fifth Division. Tall skyscrapers crowded the middle as buildings slowly shrunk until they reached the edge, where fields and trees boarded the edge of the plate.</p>

<p>â€œDoes this look familiar?â€ Fog asked with a rather stupid grin.</p>

<p>Fade took a deep breath. â€œThatâ€™s the Fifth Division, where we currently are standing.â€</p>

<p>â€œGreat!â€ He kept drawing. â€œGood to know my work is recognizable. Would have killed me if I couldnâ€™t draw our own home.â€ The marker flew from building to building, down to the pillar, and back up. â€œNow tell me when this is,â€ he commanded.</p>

<p>Scanning the board, it was clear he had added some hints. There was only one gondola connecting the Fifth Division to the Fourth Division. It was the only way to travel from one plate to another without an airship. More gondolaâ€™s had been added within the first decade of the Fifthâ€™s Divisionâ€™s opening when the First Divisionâ€™s council realized commute times were detrimentally slow.</p>

<p>â€œFifth Era, obviously,â€ Fade started. Each era was marked by the finished construction of a new division. Their division was the latest completed construction. â€œAround Year 5?â€ she asked.</p>

<p>â€œDing ding ding!â€ Fog chanted. He was obviously excited to see something that was close to a right answer. Fade sighed with relief. â€œFifth Era, Year 7. You can tell this by the newly constructed scaffolding all across the Fifth Divisionâ€™s pillar.â€</p>

<p>New scaffolding? Fadeâ€™s face was riddled with confusion. Once pillarâ€™s were constructed, they never needed repairs. The combination of materials was impossibly strong. â€œWhat was with the scaffolding?â€ Fade asked. â€œI thought main construction was done once the Fifth Era startedâ€¦â€</p>

<p>Classmates started muttering to each other with curiosity. Fog had grabbed their attention, and he knew it. The implications of his drawing were heresy. A First Division council member would have a heart attack at the implication that construction wasnâ€™t completed at the beginning of an era.</p>

<p>â€œI cannot confirm nor deny if the construction was done,â€ Fog continued. â€œAll I can say for certain is that scaffolding was on the pillar. What would you like to do?â€</p>

<p>â€œLetâ€™s get closer,â€ Fade requested. Curiosity took over her anxiety. This lesson, like so many often did, led her to an unexpected place.</p>

<p>Another pillar appeared on the metal board as the marker squeaked away in Fogâ€™s hand. This time it was a close up. Graffiti covered the pillar, various small cracks were distributed throughout giving the seven year old pillar the look of a five hundred year old pillar. It wasnâ€™t what Fade was expecting at all.</p>

<p>â€œWhy did you draw it like that?â€ Fade asked.</p>

<p>Fog chuckled. â€œThat is the way it looks. Why would I draw it any differently?â€</p>

<p>It made no sense. There was Graffiti on the pillar, which was also illegal. The object that held up the city, the literal foundation of society, was supposed to be worshiped. At least, the First Division council stated that it was supposed to be worshiped. Fade was sure the Fifth Division council couldnâ€™t care less.</p>

<p>â€œIf we learned last lesson that these pillars were made by an impossibly strong materialâ€</p>
