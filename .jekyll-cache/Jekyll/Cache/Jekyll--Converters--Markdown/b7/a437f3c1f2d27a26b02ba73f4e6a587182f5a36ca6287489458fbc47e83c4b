I"­S<p>Embers escaped into the night sky as Chelsen sat staring into the roaring bonfire. Voices from all around him were strained but what they were saying, Chelsen could not care less. All he wanted to do was leave.
â€œDid you not see a meteor descend into the sky not five days ago?â€ A young man waved his dramatically at the angle he saw the phenomenon fly upward days before.
A man across the fire sighed letting his hand drag down across his face. â€œTogtha, how many times do I have to say this. I do not care.â€ Every word could not have been said slower only aggravating Togtha even more.
â€œThis is not natural Mith! You should care. The implications of this phenomenon are huge for the School of Nature! It could change the way we think about the sky.â€ He smiled at the implications of his statement. Togtha eagerly awaited to swat down whatever Mith said.
â€œWhy should I care about the sky? The School of Science is only concerned with what we can manipulate. Have you seen any scholars deciding what the weather should be?â€ Mith spit out the question as a vein started pulsating on his head. Even his ears were starting to become a bright pink.
Chelsen stared at the two fighting. Normally he would not be obligated to witness two scholars having a debate, but Mith was his father and it would be rude to leave without asking for permission. â€œDad, can I-â€ Chelsen was interrupted by Togtha.
â€œSo you are saying the School of Nature has no consequence on your work,â€ Togtha asked. He crossed his arms satisfied. He knew he had won the debate.
Mith was about to open his mouth when Myrian sat down next to him and interjected. â€œBoth of you need to stop. This is going no where. Togtha, you should know Mith is too stubborn to be reasoned with.â€ Mith gave Myrian a dirty look as Togtha chuckled. â€œBesides, itâ€™s obvious neither of you are listening to anyone. Chelsen here obviously does not want to witness this stupidity.â€ Chelsenâ€™s face went red as everyone turned to him. â€œYes Chelsen, you are free to go.â€ Myrian waved him off.
Grateful for an escape, Chelsen quickly jumped off the ground and headed home without looking back. This was one reason why Chelsen appreciated Myrian so much. She always called things out for what they were no matter how much the truth stung.
A full moon slowly rose in the sky as Chelsen walked through the forest passing by other villagerâ€™s houses. Unlike most villages, Chelsenâ€™s own village Iris was set up in a spiral with three branches representing the three different Schools of Reasoning: the School of Nature, the School of Science, and the School of Technology. Chelsen lived on the outermost edge of the School of Science branch and not by accident. Mith was the most skilled woodcutter in all the village, not that there was much competition.
His house was faintly illuminated in the distance by a lone torch lit outside the front door. Hopping over the gate and immediately pushing open the front door, Chelsen climbed up into his side of the loft and grabbed a bag from under his bed. Just as he had speedily entered, he left. Luckily for Chelsen, most of the village would be by the bonfire making it easy for him to leave unnoticed. His destination took him west of the village where he had never explored before.
The moon had moved high up into the sky by the time Chelsen had made it to an unknown part of the forest. When he finally found a clearing illuminated by the moon, he rested his bag on a rock and took out a tanned piece of leather and some charcoal. The unrolled piece of leather revealed a landscape very poorly drawn outlining the landmarks near and around Iris. The Great Scar, the biggest river in all of Domhain, made the eastern border of the land surrounding Iris. All the other directions, north, south, and west were large mountains. Off in the distance, no matter where you were in the forest, it was easy to see Cloud Breaker Mountain in the west. All of these characteristics were already drawn on the map. Chelsen continued to draw in more forest west of Iris and any notable landmarks that could help a person navigate the windy forest.
The moon had moved quite a bit further in the night sky by the time Chelsen saw a colossal shadow in the distance. The sight confused Chelsen as the mountains west of Iris were supposed to be quite a big further away.  In fact, he was sure the village of Frelia was supposed to be before the mountains, not after.
As Chelsen approached the shadow he realized this was not a mountain, but a rather large cliff that just barely broke the roof of the forest. It was quite steep and almost looked as if some giant had put their hand into the ground and pulled out a large slab of stone to sit on the earth. From north to south the cliff extended as far as the eye could see, although it was quite hard to see even with a full moon, although oddly this cliff did not flow like a normal cliff. The walls were jagged and wildly curved as Chelsen explored the cliff southward.
It only took a couple of more minutes for a house to appear off in the distance. The small building stood crooked with its windows uncovered and its door wide open. The sight was quite odd to see so far from the village. As far as Chelsen knew, no Umana lived so far away from the village. Cautiously, Chelsen approached the house. The forest was completely silent only making him even more nervous. Every one of his steps were painfully audible. He did not want to disturb whoever may be present, but he couldnâ€™t resist the urge to look inside.
Slowly, Chelsen poked his head into one of the windows and found the place empty. No bed, no table, not even a ladder was present for the loft above. The only thing that remained were pieces of paper scattered on the floor. Sighing a breath of relief, Chelsen entered through the front door and picked one of the papers. The top of the paper was titled â€œControlled Resonance for Your Pleasureâ€ with loads of text neatly written below. Chelsen tried to read on but this was clearly the work of a scholar. He folded the paper and deposited it into his bag hoping someone back at Iris would be able to help him understand what the essay was talking about.
After looking through the rest of the house, Chelsen exited through the front door and looked back. He hadnâ€™t seen it earlier, but the name â€œVolidaâ€ was cut into the top of the door.
At this point the moon was well on its way to descending causing Chelsen to rush back to his house before Mith noticed. Unfortunately, by the time Chelsen made it back to his house Myrian and Mith were stumbling into the front gate drunk off a lack of sleep and copious amounts of wine.
â€œMith, you really ought to stop blaming yourself. I know it wasnâ€™t your fault. You didnâ€™t intend to kill them.â€ Myrian propped herself against the fence surrounding the house. â€œCan we please get past this?â€ She looked into Mithâ€™s eyes catching his attention.
Trying to be quiet, Chelsen rounded the clearing heading toward the back of the house hoping to slip through a window unnoticed. He wasnâ€™t supposed to wander out to the forest alone at night. Apparently it was too dangerous to be completely alone where no one would look to find him.
â€œIâ€™m not blaming myself, Iâ€™m just admitting the truth. No matter how innocent my request was, I ultimately caused you harm.â€ Mith too propped himself against the fence after almost tripping on a root. â€œNothing can change that.â€ Mith broke his gaze with Myrian unable to look her in the face.
â€œAlright, fine. You are already stubborn enough when sober, Iâ€™m not going to try to argue with a drunken stubborn old man. Have a good night.â€ They both embraced each other before Myrian headed back to the center of town. Being the best medic in all of Iris, her house was located much closer to the center. Everyone felt safer when she was close by.
As Mith stumbled to the front door Chelsen hopped through the side window and jumped up to the loft. By the time Mith opened the front door Chelsen was on his bed looking as if he was lying sound asleep.</p>
<hr />
<p>The sun was already high in the sky by the time Chelsen and Mith decided to get out of bed. On a normal day they would both be up at dawn chopping up trees and delivering firewood to the village, but last night was a special occasion. The village had just finished preparing for the coming Fall season far in advance of when they expected.
Both of them climbed down the loft and started preparing a meal when Myrian appeared at the front door.
â€œEating lunch? What good timing.â€ She plopped herself down on a chair and started sorting through her herb basket. â€œMith, whereâ€™s your mortar and pestle. I got something for you.â€ Both Chelsen and Mith looked at each other unsure if they should say anything. Apparently Myrian was welcomed into their home at anytime now. They had been family friends for years, but this sort of behavior was definitely out of the ordinary. Myrian rarely left her house unless she had to be out.
â€œSure, give me one second.â€ Mith stepped away from preparing the food to fetch the mortar and pestle. â€œWhat poison are you about to force feed me exactly?â€
â€œDo you want to cure your headache or not? I know you donâ€™t recover well from a whole bottle of wine regardless of whether or not it was smacked over your head.
Chelsenâ€™s head whipped around in question. â€œExcuse me? Dad, you have to tell me what that is about,â€ said Chelsen. He stopped preparing the food as well and looked into Mithâ€™s eyes expectantly.
â€œYouâ€™re wasting your time Chelsen. Mith will never tell you his embarrassing stories, nor will he let me tell them while he sits in a corner cowering. Swing by my house sometime and Iâ€™ll fill you in with the details,â€ Myrian informed Chelsen.
Mith opened his mouth to object but no words came out. Laughter filled the room followed by an awkward silence. Not wanting to know what was about to happen next, Chelsen figured it was a good time to step out. Taking a slice of bread and his leather bag before exiting he told them, â€œIâ€™ll be back, got something I want to do.â€
As soon as Chelsen exited the house he could hear Mith and Myrian talking with hushed voices. Something was going on between them and Chelsen did not want to be there to find out. Luckily, the sky was bright blue with not a cloud in sight. Today would be one of the last days filled with nothing but relaxing as the villagers of Iris would all be recovering from last nights party.
Just as Chelsen had done the night before, he started walking towards the western forest. The name Volida kept flashing through his mind. He needed to know more about this person, but he wasnâ€™t sure where to start. Iris didnâ€™t have many bards and he wasnâ€™t too keen to try to get answers from a half conscious scholar today. It didnâ€™t take too long for Chelsen to make it back to the mysterious house. Now that there was more light than the previous night, Chelsen took out his map and started mapping out the cliff side in great detail.
The further south Chelsen traveled, the more windy the cliff side appeared to get. All the stone raising out of the ground still looked like it was torn out of the ground. Eventually the cliff suddenly stopped revealing a weird set of canyon entrances. Chelsen continued to map out each cliff as the sun rose over his head and slowly started descending. By late afternoon the leather map had almost half of the cliff outlined. From what was drawn, it almost looked like this mysterious cliff resembled a tree. Near Volidaâ€™s house was a trunk. South of his house was more trunk eventually leading to roots with spaces in-between each root creating the canyonâ€™s Chelsen saw earlier.
Perplexed by his findings and tired from the gnawing hunger of his belly constantly rumbling, Chelsen turned back towards Iris. What could have possibly caused a cliff to resemble a tree so precisely? This was indeed a strange phenomenon that one of the School of Nature scholars surely would have an answer to. Hopefully the day had given everyone enough time to recover from the party last night as Chelsen was too excited to wait any longer for answers. He picked up the pace and was able to get to Iris well before sunset.
When Chelsen did finally arrive, Myrian was walking towards her house on the outskirts of town. The two caught each otherâ€™s eyes and started approaching eachother.
â€œYou were out for quite some time. What are you up to playing out in the forest? Donâ€™t you get enough of wandering around the woods cutting trees down?â€ Myrianâ€™s eyebrows raised quizzically.
â€œActually I was wondering if you could point me in the right direction,â€ Chelsen said. â€œIâ€™ve found a couple of things that need explaining.â€ He fumbled in his leather bag for the piece of paper he collected from Volidaâ€™s house. â€œI found this in a house near the cliffâ€™s west of here.â€ He handed Myrian the paper.
She grabbed the paper and unfolded it. Her face immediately grew somber. After taking a couple of deep breaths she responded, â€œmaybe we should talk about this over some tea. What do you say?â€
Unsure why Myrian would know about anything related to resonance, Chelsen agreed. The two of them walked to Myrianâ€™s house towards the center of the village. Inside her house were herbs sitting by the windows drying. All the walls were stocked with shelves of more plants in pots and bundles of herbs. Vines grew over the shelves and over the walls. Even her loft was filled with dried herbs and tools Chelsen assumed were used to create different types of medicine.
â€œPlease, sit down.â€ Myrian motioned towards a chair and Chelsen happily obliged after a long day of walking around mapping out a cliff. Just as she did before, Myrian unfolded the paper and looked at the essay but this time her face seemed a little more happy. â€œDo you know who Volida is?â€
â€œNope, not a clue,â€ Chelsen responded.
â€œThey were a friend of mine. A best friend, actually. We were partners for life. Unfortunately, as you may have noticed, Volida isnâ€™t around anymore.â€ The lack of directness shook Chelsen. He had never heard Myrian be so vague before. â€œItâ€™s a long story, but one worth telling if you want to hear it.â€
With an introduction like that Chelsen was unable to resist finding out more. â€œPlease! If you feel comfortable telling me Iâ€™d love to know.â€
Myrian got up and started a small fire to boil some water. She didnâ€™t turn around but instead just stared into the flame. â€œThis story goes pretty far back before you were born. Do you know about Saol at all? I canâ€™t imagine Mith has told you much about the outside world.â€
â€œI guess I havenâ€™t heard of Saol. Where is that,â€ Chelsen asked. Unfortunately, Mith was much more content teaching Chelsen how to be a proper woodcutter rather than teaching him about all the other villages and towns of the north-western continent of Domhain.
â€œSaol is a town just south of here. Many of the people of Iris come from there in search of a quieter place to study their craft. You could say Saol is the hub of all trade and the home to all Schools of Reasoning. I was originally there to study music in the School of Science.â€ Myrian broke her gaze from the fire and looked back at Chelsenâ€™s confused face. â€œYes, my trade was originally music, not all this.â€ She waved her hand to all the herbs surrounding them.
â€œWhat happened?â€ Chelsen couldnâ€™t help but to keep pressing for more answers. He rarely got stories of anyoneâ€™s past. All scholars typically liked talking about were their studies, not their pasts.
â€œA lot happened in Saol. I become quite a prominent figure in the School of Science. Many of the instruments created by the School of Technology was in large part possible because of my studies in the School of Science. Well, I guess I should say our studies. Volida was a the scholar making the instruments from my research.â€ The water was boiling at this point. Myrian quickly turned around and poured the water into a couple of cups. She grabbed a couple of tea leaves and tossed them in to their drinks handing a cup to Chelsen. â€œWe made a great team. Volida was absolutely fascinated my work and often times Iâ€™m pretty sure they would stop â€˜by my studyâ€™ even on days they were not working. The more time we spent working together, the closer we got.â€
As much as Chelsen loved to hear about her relationship this still had nothing to do with why his discovery was near Iris. â€œThatâ€™s lovely, but why is Volidaâ€™s name on a house just west of here?â€
â€œI said this was a long story!â€ Myrian snapped. â€œIf you want your answers your going to have to listen to the hole thing.â€ Chelsen shuffled in his chair making himself comfortable. It was obvious this was going to be a while. â€œAs I was saying, we spent more time together. I was never one to go out to parties but Volida had an insatiable thirst for attention. It was kind of ridiculous.â€ Myrian chuckled to herself. â€œVolida was the reason why I stayed in Saol for so long. Unfortunately, that bustling town life was too distracting for me. I wanted to have more time for my research and less time drinking at bars. One day, I told Volida I was going to Iris to continue my studies in peace.â€
â€œSo Volida followed you here?â€ Chelsen couldnâ€™t help himself. He was interested in Myrianâ€™s past but he now had so many more questions. Where is Volida? What happened?
â€œSurprisingly, yes. I never thought Volida would trade a bustling life of Saol for a quiet cabin near Iris. Within the next couple of days we moved to Iris and started building a house. We continued our studies in peace. Whenever Volida was deprived of their attention and could not get enough from me, they would constantly go into Iris playing their new instruments. That is how I met Mith. Volida had made great friends with him.â€
â€œWait a second!â€ Chelsen narrowed his eyebrows. â€œMy father new Volida? Why didnâ€™t he mention his name to me?â€
â€œWell, your father is a lot more awkward than you think he is. Also much more adventurous.â€ Myrian took a sip from her cup and placed it on the small table sitting next to Chelsenâ€™s chair.
â€œMy father, adventurous? Nice try. He never goes far from the house.â€ Chelsen mimicked Myrian and also set aside his cup.
â€œThat may be true today, but before you were born he traveled all around the lands surrounding Iris. He had a dangerous habit of rock climbing near Cloud Breaker Mountain.â€ Myrianâ€™s eyes locked with Chelsenâ€™s. â€œWhich is a dumb thing to do. Never go near that mountain, itâ€™s full of bandits. Understand?â€
Chelsen nodded. He had heard Mith say this much. Everyone knew that mountain was the place anyone flees to if they are in trouble and donâ€™t want someone to follow them. The mere idea that Mith would rock climb there was absurd.
â€œWell anyways, one day Mith decided to rock climb right before a storm was coming in. Volida argued against Mith doing something so reckless, but knowing how stubborn your father is I canâ€™t imagine anything would have stopped him. Later that night we were not surprised to see your father being carted back to the Iris medic a complete mess. A villager from Frelia had found his mangled body and immediately grabbed their cart to transport him.â€
â€œAs you can imagine, Volida heard this news almost instantly and brought me to see him. He was in terrible shape. The medic had told Volida and I that he would die unless we could get a specific herb she needed to heal some of his gross wounds. Naturally Volida volunteered. He was tasked with climbing the cliff you found just west of here to get a rare flower that grew at the top of that cliff.â€ Myrian paused, taking another sip of her tea. Her voice was starting to shake as she spoke. â€œHad I known that was the last time I would see Volida healthy, I would have told them so much. I would have had time to say goodbye.â€
A tear fell down her cheek as she continued. â€œVolida successfully climbed the cliff and got the flower, but since it was storming outside they slipped and fell down from nearly the top of the cliff. I had no choice but to leave them, get the flower to the medic, and call for help. I wanted to ease his pain but there was nothing I could do.â€ Myrian took a couple of deep breaths and continued. â€œYou can probably guess how the rest of the story goes. Your fatherâ€™s life was saved, but my partner Volida died at that very cliff we now call Volidaâ€™s Peak. I do not blame your father for their death, but I cannot same the same for how he feels.â€
The whole story hit Chelsen like a tidal wave. This explained a lot. Mith was always so worried about Chelsen traveling far. He never wanted Chelsen to be reckless. It also cleared up why Mith was always so awkward around Myrian. One thing still bothered Chelsen. â€œWhy did you stop studying music?â€
Myrian frowned. â€œSimple, the notes donâ€™t bring me joy anymore. Every time I tried to continue my studies all I could think of was that night looking at Volidaâ€™s contorted body. Rather than study something so painful, I decided to make sure I was never stuck in suck a helpless situation again. Here I am, ready to fix any problem that comes in my way.â€</p>
