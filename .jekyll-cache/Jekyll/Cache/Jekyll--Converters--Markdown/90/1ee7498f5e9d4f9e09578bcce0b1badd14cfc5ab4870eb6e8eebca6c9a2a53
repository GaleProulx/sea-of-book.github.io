I"ì'<p>Days upon days passed by as Chelsen fell in and out of consciousness. The weather was becoming colder, the moon had already waxed and waned, and some of the trees were just starting to change colors. The end of summer was racing by as Chelsen recovered from nearly unraveling into a pile of dust.</p>

<p>Most days it hurt to move in any capacity. The weird reflective beings which Chelsen called Comptana, which is a word they would repeat very often, were constantly placing strange objects on his skin. What they were doing was hard to tell, but they seemed very happy when they‚Äôd look at the colors moving around on their tools.</p>

<p>Whatever the Comptana were doing to him, it seemed to be fighting off the plague quite well. The bruises that had so quickly covered his body were disappearing slowly but surely. Unfortunately, or fortunately, Chelsen hadn‚Äôt decided yet, the bruises receding were not the only changes that had occurred. His body was different in many ways. For starters, he never got hungry anymore. It was a strange feeling to not eat for so long. Rest and relaxation always seemed to push away the feelings of dreariness. It had been so long since he‚Äôd eaten anything that his mouth was starting to smell really bad. Despite the lack of food he never got weaker, but stronger instead. Also, he was physically getting stronger. Before Chelsen never really had any noticable muscles, but the slightest signs that he may indeed be a very fit person were starting to show. This new feeling made him very prone to tripping and awkwardly not being able to do simple things like getting up from the ground without reworking how it felt to do so.</p>

<p>Today, Chelsen had felt better than they had in a while, and was hoping to finally climb down the cliff. Unfortunately, it appeared the Comptana did a fairly good job of making sure he didn‚Äôt escape. It wasn‚Äôt a prison, but they also appeared to not want to lose sight of their new experiment. It was about midday when one of the Comptana approached Chelsen this time with no objects in their hands.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat are you going to do?‚Äù Chelsen asked. As usual, there was no response. They were silent. This was another part of why Chelsen wanted to leave. The Comptana made terrible company. Last season he would have loved to have some peace and quiet, but even this was too much.</p>

<p>The Comptana moved closer extending its weird hand out. These creatures, from what Chelsen could tell, had three different fingers. Each finger had a round bulb on the end that could glow. Whenever they touched Chelsen‚Äôs head with these fingers it usually didn‚Äôt end well.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCan we not do this again? Please?‚Äù The Comptana continued to waddle closer. These creatures had insanely short legs and big feet. They couldn‚Äôt really run. The best they could do was waddle. If they weren‚Äôt so reflective they would almost be cute. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs a no then.‚Äù</p>

<p>Chelsen kneeled down so the Comptana could place all three bulb-finger-tips on his head and a warm feeling seeped through Chelsen‚Äôs brain. Random words whizzed by as if multiple people were trying to talk to Chelsen while running by. His skin started itching on his arms and legs. Blue lights danced in front of his eyes. Suddenly, Mith appeared in front of him, looking away. Intense pleasure spontaneously filled his body followed by dread and then anger.</p>

<p>‚ÄúEnough,‚Äù yelled Chelsen. Grasping the Comptana‚Äôs arm pushed the hand away. As soon as the contact was lost the blue lights faded and Mith disappeared. All the voices stopped and there was dead silence. This time sorrow followed the mix of emotions. He tried to not think about Iris. It was almost a certainty that no one had made it. If these creatures had to spend this much time healing him, he doubted anyone could survive such a vicious disease. Even Chelsen, without a knowledge of medicine, knew that not even Myrian could solve this one. No one had looked for Chelsen. No one went near Volida‚Äôs peak. That couldn‚Äôt be a coincidence.</p>

<p>Tears started to well up in Chelsen‚Äôs eyes. Now, more than ever, loneliness hit him right in the gut. He had to check. He needed to make sure Iris was gone. Staying in limbo like this was too much.</p>

<p>The Comptana slowly backed away from Chelsen and went back to the other Comptana who was tapping away on their devices. It felt like they were getting nowhere. Every time they tried to communicate, which is what they appeared to be doing as they seem very capable of killing anything with a touch, they failed.</p>

<p>Tonight. He couldn‚Äôt wait any longer. Once the sun fell Chelsen would sneak out and look for the remnants of the village.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was only a few nights away from being a new moon which was only going to make the trek harder. When Chelsen woke up, the Comptana were still deep in whatever it was that they were doing. Trying to be quiet, although unsure if these creatures could even hear with how silent they were, Chelsen slowly got up and started walking towards the edge of Volida‚Äôs Peak. It didn‚Äôt appear that the Comptana had even noticed by the time he was nearly out of sight. When the dark ground finally stopped clearly outlined by the dark canopy of the forest below, Chelsen slowly moved one foot down, then the other trying to find footholds. Climbing up the cliff felt like it would be significantly easier.</p>

<p>At least an hour had passed when Chelsen finally felt the ground beneath his feet. It had been so long since he was not looking above the trees. Slowly his shoulders relaxed. He hadn‚Äôt even noticed he was that tense. Taking a couple of steps forward it was easy to notice how barren the ground was. Even in the dark it was easy to see no trees had leaves on them. It was almost as if a fire had burned down the forest. The canopy Chelsen had seen earlier appeared to be just a bunch of barren branches.</p>

<p>In the middle of the clearing between the forest and the cliff‚Äôs side was a face down body. It hadn‚Äôt decayed fully. It still looked like an Umana. Cautiously approaching it, Chelsen kneeled down to get a better look. It was hard to who it was from all the bruises. The clothes that the person was wearing had mostly decayed. Any hair that might have been on the skin was gone leaving an unnaturally smooth shell of a person. Taking a couple of deep breaths, Chelsen flipped the body over. A little black dust fluttered into the air as the body landed on its back. The face didn‚Äôt look great, but it was still recognizable. Chelsen blinked a couple of times taking the picture in. The sight wasn‚Äôt pretty, but it was undoubtedly his father. Mith lay in the dirt with his face contorted in pain. Checking for a pulse, Chelsen quickly reached over and touched his neck. There was nothing. His skin was cold and bruised. It appeared Chelsen was right to assume that everyone had not made it.</p>

<p>As he tried to stand back up, the world started to spin. Placing a hand on the ground to steady himself, he tried to focus on the trees that appeared to be moving around him. His ears started to ring almost as if all the blood from his head was draining. His breathing quickened. Shallow breaths, as if there wasn‚Äôt enough air to breath in. As if he was drowning.</p>

<p>This was real. Everything was real. Something came in, something took away the world he knew. Nothing would be the same. This was the new reality.</p>

<p>Chelsen sat down comprehending the gravity of the situation. Iris wasn‚Äôt just probably gone, it was definitely gone. Even Mith couldn‚Äôt escape. Some of Domhain‚Äôs greatest minds just vanished. Unsure of what to do next, Chelsen kept walking towards Iris.</p>

<p>Traveling through the forest did not feel the same. No underbrush was left. Some landmarks still stood tall, but much of the landscape had changed. Some trees were just completely gone or in the middle of falling apart. Other areas that looked so full of life were now just empty rock faces and piles of dirt.</p>

<p>It took a little bit for Chelsen to find the village as he almost got lost twice trying to navigate the almost familiar terrain. On the outskirts of the village there were more bodies. These ones looked worse. Bruises did cover them on top of their limbs decaying. One had no legs, the other had no head. It looked like the sickness slowly ate them alive turning them into the black dust that settled on the dirt. Looking at the outskirts of the village, it was hard to recognize where he was. Some of the houses had started to decay as well. Walls fell apart, Doors left on the ground with corners missing, even parts of fences looked as if they had been burned away.</p>

<p>Moving closer and closer to the center of the village, more and more bodies were scattered across the ground most of them almost completely turned to dust. After a few hours, Chelsen finally found what he suspected was Myrian‚Äôs house. Walking through the front, the door no longer being present, he saw something up in the loft. The supports to the loft still looked solid enough, so he jumped up and climbed his way up despite the pain he was feeling. Laying on the loft was Myrian‚Äôs body. Most of here hair was completely black, her body also covered in bruises. Unlike most other people, she hadn‚Äôt decayed much of all. Placing his hand on her neck, she too was completely cold. There was no way she was alive. Everyone was dead.</p>

<p>Jumping off the loft Chelsen dragged Myrian‚Äôs body to the center of the village where bonfire‚Äôs were, or used to be, ignited. There wasn‚Äôt any wood left. Scouring for firewood, Chelsen eventually got enough to fuel a fire. Unfortunately, there wasn‚Äôt anything to start the bonfire. He tried to build some makeshift tools, and worked throughout the night to light a fire. He wanted to give Myrian a proper burial.</p>

<p>Eventually the moon was setting and the morning was on the brink of rising. Chelsen fell asleep on the very wood he was trying to heat up. Nothing was going as planned.</p>
