I"P<p>In the quaint little town of Hopeless lived Spot and Maisey, two cows destined to be friends for life. With green pastures and greater dreams, these two cows spent most of their time wandering the fields hoping for a little excitement. Unfortunately, their farmer named Cal had moved to the town of Hopeless years ago after an accident occurred causing all the neighboring farmers to revolt. Apparently leaving a cow sized hole in the side of a neighbors house was not an acceptable way to handle ones farm. Needless to say, Spot and Maisey have no neighbors now and therefore no fun.</p>
