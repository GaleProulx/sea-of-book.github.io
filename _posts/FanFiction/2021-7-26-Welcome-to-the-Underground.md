Main Character: Locus - Xael Striker

"Name?" the man asks defeatedly from behind the plastic folding table. His voice is a little raspy, face a little sullen, but he seems like a nice guy. "Um, hey. Are you able to talk?"

Additional details include very dark hair, five o'clock shadow, nice muscle tone. Of course I'm probably looking like a creep now that I can't stop staring at him. "Locus," I choke out.

"Sorry, what was that?" he asks again. It's odd, he's not angry. For once someone is patient with me. Guess it makes sense. I'm definitely not the first mutant to stop by the underground.

It takes me a second to build up the courage to speak the name out loud. Last time I did my parents kicked me out of the house. "Locus," I say more assertively.

He scribbles the name down in the binder. "Nice name," he complements. The tiniest smile sneaks in. I almost miss it. "What was your given name? We need to do a quick background check."

Admittedly, this comes as a shock. I have nothing to hide, I haven't broken any laws that matter. I guess I just didn't think it would be assumed every mutant has a criminal record. 

And there I go again... staring at him lost in thought. "Xael Striker," I say.

This time he doesn't smile. Instead, this time he frowns. It's so subtle I think most people would miss it. Unfortunately, I notice. He asks me how to spell it. Once he's done recording my name he continues the questioning session. "Age, gender, and are there any medications you need? Can't make any promises, but we'll do the best we can."

I sigh. Whenever someone asks for gender, I always have to question if they mean sex. "24, trans woman, and estrogen would be fantastic but it's not required."

Naturally his eyebrows lift a little when I say trans but thank someone for not having to explain myself. With one last sigh he asks one last question. "Alrighty, I just need to know one more thing: what's your power?"

Letting myself take a few deep breaths I respond, "focusing I think. Not a telepath, I can't read thoughts. All I can do is help people focus and enhance their powers." I pause. I'm always hesitant to say the second part of the description. Unfortunately, I want to stay with this group so I say the rest. It's probably for the best if I don't start immediately lying. "It goes both ways. I can also make it so a person can't focus. Basically, I can incapacitate a person."

After he's done madly scribbling everything I just said he responds, "welcome to the underground Locus, my name is Marcos. That man over there is Fade," he points to the most stereotypical cowboy I've ever seen. Scruffy with a mustache that could scream "yeeha" louder than I could. To top things off he is literally wearing the staple cowboy hat. "He'll take you to your bunk once the rest of your group is checked in. Let us know if you need anything."

Suddenly I find myself walking over to Fade who greets me with little more than a head nod. I was one of the first in line so the other five mutants take a bit of time to be processed.

While I'm waiting it's easy to let my eyes wander, so I let them. Put simply, the place looks like shit. Bunk beds are scattered everywhere, random holes are in both the walls and floor, storage crates line every empty space. Even for a mansion the place feels pretty crowded. All different types of mutants are scattered around talking, working, resting, or practicing how to use their powers. A couple of adults are standing at the main staircase whispering an argument. They look rather important.

A tap on my shoulder snaps me back to reality. It's Fade. I look back and he tips his head and softly commands, "let's go." Our group of mutants follows him down the main staircase and further into the back of the building. We pass by a giant vault. Maybe this mansion is actually an abandoned bank? Fade gestures us towards a small side room. There are three bunks shoved into the room in a very creative fashion. Two bunk beds sprout from one corner jammed into each other, the other somehow fits right in front of the opened door.

Fade clears his throat before speaking. "This will be your room. Feel free to rest here and store any personal items here. If you plan on moving again soon, I would recommend you don't unpack too much. Convoys can come in short notice. Also, don't wander from the estate. If you get in trouble and lead Sentinel Services here we're all dead." With that wonderful piece of advice he gives a weak smile, a curt nod, and quickly walks out of the room and back up the main staircase.

Everyone from the group shuffles in and claims a bunk. Naturally, I space out and get the last one right in front of the door. Wonderful. Placing my backpack down, I take out my journal. Flipping it open I come to the last entry. It was months ago when I was writing about the wonders of finally getting gender affirmation surgery. If only I had known what was to come.

A voice came out of nowhere (actually right in front of me) nearly making me fall out of bed. "Hey, my name's Andy," a boy introduced himself. He held out a blanket.

"My name's Xael they/them," I respond while taking the blanket. His face flinches slightly. Strangers almost always flinch. No one expects such a deep voice.

Andy moves to my other roommates as a girl walks up from behind him. "Nice to meet you Xael, my name's Lauren she/her." She places a pillow on top of the blanket I'm holding.

We all thank the both of them and tend to ourselves. A couple roommates walk out of the room, a couple of others seem to fall asleep almost instantly. The person above my bed hangs down awkwardly obviously wanting to start a conversation. "Xael, that's an unusual name. Where'd it come from?"

I shrug. "Came from my parents," I answer. "When I came out I asked them to give me a new name, so they picked something not so gendered." My new top bunkmate stares at me as if delving into my soul. Something felt a little off about this person. "What's your name?" I ask trying to break the awkward silence.

"Xenon he/him," he said offering a handshake. I reluctantly accepted it. "Wild that we bunked together. We're probably the only two people in the whole shelter who have X's in their names," he points out.

"Something tells me that's not so coincidental," I reply. 

He gives a sly smile. "Alright fine, I may have overheard you spell out your name but hey, you were the only person I had something in common with."

I give him the stink eye. "Fine, fair enough. Now I get to ask a question: why'd your parents name you after a gas?"

His stupid grin got even more stupid. "Parent's were both chemists. Unfortunately, the thing they loved more than each other was a periodic table. They threw a dart at one and left my name picking up to chance."

"Wow, I guess you should be thankful they didn't land on Helium or Francium or something," I joke.

"Guess you're right," he plays along.

Closing my journal I slide it underneath my pillow. I didn't try hiding it, there was no sense. It would be stupid to expect privacy in this place. "Well Xenon," I start. "It was nice to meet you. I'll see you around." With a skip in my step I exit our little side-room and hop into the middle of the basement. 

A few plastic tables have been set up with basic supplies: food, water, rags. As I wonder around it's easy to see this place is starting to fill up. Every room has bunks with people in them. No one seems super energetic. The atmosphere is dead.

Rather abruptly towards the back of the basement a jail cell sits empty with a computer den right next to it. A woman is sitting at the computer typing faster than humanly possible. She looks like a stereotypical hacker from a movie but from what I can tell she can actually work like one as well. Text flies around each monitor, windows pop up and blip out almost instantaneously. It's wild.

"Can I help you?" I hear someone ask from behind.

Turning around, all I see is a hulk. Not literally a green giant, but the man is huge. Built like what the army advertises: bulging muscles and shoulders that would even make football players jealous. "Ahh, no," I so eloquently spit out.

He takes a moment to size me up. I don't like it. "Are you new here?" he queries.

Honestly, he doesn't have to ask twice. There's no way I'm messing with him. "Yep!" I squeak. "Name's Xael, they/them, 24 years old-"

He raises his hand and I go silent. I'm not sure why I go silent but I do. It was almost as if he gave the quiet coyote sign in first grade. "Nice to meet you, name's John. I'm going to ask that you don't come back here. This space is reserved for leaders."

Taking a step back I whisper, "yes sir," and turn around walking back to my room. Not another word is uttered until Xenon is standing right in front of me.

"Already getting in trouble?" he asks.

His stupid smile keeps sneaking in. What's he got to be so happy about? "No," I respond.

"Good!" he says. "Let's go explore!" Before I realize what's going on he takes my hand and for some reason I'm following. Back up the main staircase we go to the west wing that was obviously at one point a bunch of offices. If I had to guess, this was a really old bank in an ancient building that was converted long ago. Long windows, victorian era doors and walls. The story behind the awkward hallways and creaky floorboards must be fascinating.

"Where are we going exactly?" I ask suddenly realizing I have no idea where he just took me.

"I dunno," he whispers. "I told you, we're exploring!" Right away he walks off down the long hallway to a spiral staircase. For someone who's never been in the building, he sure seems to be walking with a lot of confidence.

"Wait for me!" I hiss back as I tippy toe down the hallway trying not to wake anyone up. It feels pretty safe to assume that almost every room is full. Last thing I wanted to do was wake someone up and make them mad.

By the time I reach a beautiful spiral staircase Xenon is already close to the very top. Rushing up the stairs I pass by floor after floor of long hallways leading to more offices. The whole setup is bizarre. On the final floor (I think we climbed five stories?) there's an attic-like space. Some slanted ceilings, a couple of sky lights, and an enormous amount of junk lines the floor with a couple of clear paths leading to various doors. As expected, Xenon is already at one of those doors opening it.

Walking in between all the junk, I make it through the door to the outside. There's a nice balcony with a view of mostly trees. It's quiet, almost as if everything in the world stopped. Only the sound of the wind brushing the tops of trees fills the air. I feel my shoulders relax. I had no idea I was that tense.

"Wow, now this is nice!" Xenon observes looking into a giant field surrounded by forest. 

He was right, it was beautiful. For a place with such tragic connotations, this was a very peaceful environment. Apparently Xenon has no regard for how high up we are as he hoists himself up onto the railing and takes a seat. Looking back at me he pats a place right next to the railing. He seriously expects me to join him? "No thanks, I'm too clumsy to not fall off that edge," I respond. And of course he frowns with disappointment. 

"Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on you," he reassures.

Somehow I don't think he's going to take no for an answer. With a huge sigh I walk up to the stone railing. The top is nice and flat with a beautiful pattern carved into it making it look like flowers are swirling up each post. Taking one leg I swing over sideways awkwardly straddling the railing. Ignoring Xenon's giggle I swing the other leg over and clutch the railing. We are high up; really really high up. It's almost as if the terrifying height is inviting me to jump. I start to lean forward only to be pulled back.

"Woah, you really aren't great with heights, are you?" he says more of a statement than a question. I shake my head. "Fair enough, I really will keep an eye on you."
