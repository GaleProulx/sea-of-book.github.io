Normally someone who exists to terrify you would look scary. Mangled face, psychotic composure, scissors for hands, something! I guess this villain missed the memo. He (I think he) decided their persona should be personified by a cone on their head. More specifically, a traffic cone, painted brown, and flattened to look like a pyramid. Worst costume ever. Even their weapon is dumb, portraying more of a drastically over sized butter-knife look than a giant butcher-knife. We call him Pyramid Head, because that is what he look like.

Unfortunately for him, the extent of his silliness doesn't end here. He wobbles when he walks. Not wobbly in a way that looks like he might be injured, he just looks like a penguin that is trying to imitate humans sped up.

Last but not least, is his super power. Every villain has one. Pyramid Head just happens to throw up black spikes from the earth he scars with his giant butter-knife he can barely lift. Pathetic. The Nurse was so much worse teleporting immense distances. Having a coughing hag that can show up at any moment resembling every angry mom ever is terrifying. Having Pyramid Head struggling to wobble to you is not.
