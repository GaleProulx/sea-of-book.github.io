"Yes Fade, I am The Creator!" Flames burst from the floor behind The Creator. Pillars started tumbling down as the palace buckled. Fade blinked a couple of times, threw her hair back, and looked down the sight of her rifle. Typical villain with a typical agenda. She had plenty of time. After all, the villainâ€™s speech was only half over. "Everything you love and cherish I will destroy! This palace is just the start. I'll destroy every place of worship that does not honor me! Nothing can stop me." Fade casually slide a glowing green bullet into the chamber. Her fingers traced the side of engraved barrel. Gold and sapphire glittered on the side of the gun telling of a great story lost in time. "Bow before me and I will spare you. Defy me, and I will make your namesake the thing that defines you. You will fade away from history, just like your name." Fade smirked. Her name was famous, but long before this power-hungry mongrel decided to meddle with magic far beyond The Creator's comprehension. Fade widened her stance just to be sure she didn't have to make a second shot. "What are you doing? Pointing a stick at me as if it will have any affect. Nothing can break my magic. I am-" Fade pulled the trigger. The all mighty creator dropped dead onto the floor along with the pyrotechnics show in the background. The glowing green bullet (now red with blood) was stuck in tact to the wall behind.

"Why do they always have to make a speech?" Fade muttered to herself. With a little dance in her step, she skipped right past The Creator's body and climbed the wall. Bullet safely in her hip poach, Fade backflipped back onto the ground, landing in a power pose. Nothing in the palace looked the same after that small interaction. One pillar in the palace stood untouched. Everything else was cut in half or melted. Even the ceiling was letting in a considerable amount more of sunlight than before. None of the stained glass windows were saved. "What a shame." 

Behind the cracked altar was a small, stone passageway that led underground. Along the walls were carved stories of ancient times that slid between her fingers as she descended the metal stairs. Slowly the tales transitioned from the birth of magic to the birth of technology. Soon after the melding of these two ideas grew birth to buildings far taller than should be possible, and tools that reached much farther than they appeared. These celebrations of two schools of thought connecting developed a society that produced great creativity and destruction. The gun slung across Fade's back ocassionally tapped against the stories lost to time but not to these walls.

Exiting the staircase led straight to a pitch-black cavern with only clattering of the catwalk filling the space. With a snap of her fingers, the glowing green pullet nuzzled its way out of the pouch and into her hand, illuminating a magnificent room decorated with gems unlike any others. A metal catwalk surrounded an airship just big enough to house one person for a long journey. Part of the envelope was damaged during The Creator's ruckus, forcing the ship to rely on the ropes tying it down for support to keep it up. "Thank you Creator, now I have my work cut out for me."

Fade swung the gun off her back and rested it on the guard rail. The green bullet floated out of her hand beside her, still illuminating the hanger. Taking in a deep breath, she started to reenact the magical stances she learned so long ago. Within minutes the cavern started emanating the same green glow of the magic bullet. Rocks and debris started flying back into the ceiling of the hanger fitting perfectly with each piece that broke off. Soon the rocks that broke apart molded back together. Parts of the catwalk bending under the pressure sprang back into their normal, rigid position as the envelope of the aircraft zipped back up. Ropes that were broken and strained tightened up and refolded back onto the catwalk guard rails. Everything was back in place as if nothing had been touched. Fade stopped making the motions and wiped the sweat off her forehead. Picking up her rifle and calling back the bullet into her hand, she lazily walked to the deck of the airship and opened the tiny cabin door.

Screams echoed off the cavern walls as Fade jumped back at the unexpected site. A child was sitting on her bed, apparently unphased by all recent events. He flung his feet back in forth in a playful way, causing his far-too-long scarf to tangle at his feet. The goggles on his head were slightly lopsided and his stripped shirt was an obnoxious neon yellow with dark blue stripes.

"Who are you? Do you know where my parents are?" The child spoke with a squeaky voice as they hopped off the bed and approached Fade, who was slowly backing up to the edge of the ship.

"What are you? Did The Creator make minions when I wasn't looking?" The child tilted their head causing the goggles to fall off subsequently tumbling to the bottom of the hanger. They genuinely had no idea what she was talking about.

"My goggles! Noo! Please, hunter person, can you help me? I can't do any magic yet." His little hands held the edge of the airship as he carefully peered over the side of the airship, scarf tucked under his belly.

"How? That airship was crushed! You can't just appear out of nowhere! Also my magic doesn't resurrect the dead. How long have you been down here? I need answers kid!" At this point Fade was one step from falling off the airship, empty gun pointed at the kid, bullet still floating next to her head.

"Please! My goggles..." Tears started forming in his hopeful eyes.

"Okay, I'll get your goggles, but you have to tell me who you are after this. Got it?" A tiny nod followed by less sniffling. Without hesitation, Fade jumped off the airship hanging on to the glowing bullet which slowly lowered her to the ground. Releasing the bullet, she sent it to search for the goggles. The bottom of the hanger was in much worse shape than the top, despite the repairs she made. Colossal cobwebs covered all corners and created a maze below the airship. Staying as still as possible, Fade waited for the bullet to stop moving. Bingo. The light was emanating from the opposite side of the ship that they were dropped. Using her gun to swipe away the cobwebs, she slowly made her way to the goggles. The bullet was hovering just a couple inches over the headband. Before Fade could grab the goggles, a giant spider crawled over the lens. 

"Nope! Absolutely not!" Fade screamed. The bullet flung into her gun and a loud bang bounced off all the walls of the hanger.

"Hello? Did you die?" The kids voice was distant.

"We're good! I think..." Looking back the goggles, one of the lenses was vaporized along with the spider. "Whoops, they may be a little broken."

"Ta da! Here are your goggles! Now tell, who are you."

When she handed the goggles, the kid hugged them.
