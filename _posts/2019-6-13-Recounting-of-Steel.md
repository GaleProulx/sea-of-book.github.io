My life can be summed up with one word: Fibernet. This complex structure of metal pipes interlacing under the city of Steel is what I call home, but everyone else just refers to this amazing landscape as Fibernet. 

What most people don't realize about Fibernet is how free it is. Sure, you have monsters and people constantly trying to kill you, but at least there are no security checkpoints. Hell, there are no laws down in Fibernet. I guess this place is too dark and decrepit for the civilized folk above to explore. Anyone who shows up here with a moral compass will be led straight into the nearest wall. Feeling sorry for others will only get you killed. That's right, all of us down here are scum. Luckily there is nothing civilized about me, and I hope it stays that way.

When anybody above Fibernet decides to visit, they usually stick out like a sore thumb, just like the person standing in front of me. A pretty white dress that easily stains and a monocle. The people from above are so stereotypically posh. Who wears a monocle? Goggles are where it's at. One of the most essential tools. There is no lighting down in Fibrenet. Night vision goggles are the only real way to navigate. All your clothing and accessories need to be for utility, not fashion. Battery watches, arm and leg straps, compartment shoes, or anything else that holds a tool makes sense. Bracelets, not so much. Top hats, unbelievably useless. Why is the person in front of me wearing a top hat?

"Hello? Is someone there?" I can hear her voice shaking. Keep in mind I'm standing three feet in front of this person and they cannot see me. Every part of Fibrenet is dark, with only small rays of light seeping through the mass of metal pipes weaving through the top of this place. Unfortunately for this lady, they are in the darkest part of Fibrenet: The Void. Traveling to The Void is dangerous enough with the right equipment. The tunnels leading down Fibrenet are steep and pitch black. How this person accidentally wandered into this place is beyond me.

I contemplate for a second on whether or not it is worth mugging this person. The monocle has some metal on it, that might be worth something. I could always use a new pair of clothes, but the dress looks so fragile it would fall apart if I wore it. Also, it's a white dress which would slowly devolve into a bronze greasy mess if worn down here. With that last thought, I'm out of here. Some killer is sure to find her soon, and I don't want to stick around for the aftermath. Confrontation is not my thing. Little reward and high risk. In the case of this city girl, there is no reward and high risk. That makes her doubly worthless.

Continuing right past her, I glance at my battery watch. It's 9:48 PM and my personal best record for getting home from here is ten minutes. I should be able to make it before 10 PM, assuming I don't run into anyone else or accidentally set off one of my traps.

Getting back to my house is dangerous by design. Most people don't actually live in Fibernet; they live right above Fibernet. Small communities have developed in the vertical shoots that travel directly to the City of Steel. With a complex set of rope and carabiners, anything is possible. The communities are grand but exclusive. I don't fit anywhere, so I delve into The Void. Going far down, into a labyrinth of tunnels, you will eventually find my house, but you have to make it past many tripwires and false pipes. Point is, if you make it to my living quarters with both arms attached, I did my job wrong.

Having lived down here my whole life, I know a few shortcuts in The Void that are seldom traveled. A rerouted network of pipes here, a ceiling catwalk there. It's the small things that help you not accidentally run into razor-sharp pipes conveniently pointed at your shins.
