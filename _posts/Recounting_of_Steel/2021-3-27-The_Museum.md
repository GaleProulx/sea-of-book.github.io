"Come on Fade, it's almost time to go!" Vious shouted up the stairs.

Fade groggily lifted her head to look out of the one small window in her room. The glass was permanently stained around the sides making the exact middle of the window the only clear spot. It was already sunrise. She was late. Freaking out, Fade slipped out of bed and flattened the covers. Scavenging for the pillows she threw off while sleeping, she scrambled to make her bed while using one foot to open her dresser. Today was a family day. She didn't want to get her parents in a bad mood from the first minute they left.

"Coming Mom!" Fade shouted as she rummaged through her clothes. At the very back was the only dress she had. She always saved it for special occasions. A day where all three of them had a day to themselves was indeed, a special occasion.

"Fade!" shouted Obli. Before Fade knew it, they were stomping up the stairs.

"Nini, please give me one minute," Fade requested as she closed the door.

"Is everything alright?" Obli asked.

Sitting on the floor at her desk, Fade's hands were shaking as she tried to apply eyeliner. "Yes," she responded with her voice shaking far more than she wished.

"Are you sure? That wasn't a very convincing yes."

Nini always knew when Fade was about to cry and it drove her insane. She had no secrets in front of Nini and she knew it. Before she could stop herself tears started rolling down her cheeks ruining the sub-par work she had just applied.

"Oh Fade, don't cry." Obli opened the door and sat down at the desk. "What's wrong? This day is supposed to be fun."

Hearing this loud and clear, Fade cried harder. "I'm sorry, I don't mean to screw things up." Without any grace, she wiped the tears from her face leaving black streaks across her arm.

Signing, Obli took a rag off the desk and dabbed at Fade's face. "Is that what this is about?" Taking Fade's arm, they started rubbing off the watery eyeliner. "Dear, don't stress. We just want to get there early so we can do as much as possible together. This isn't supposed to make you miserable."

At this point Fade couldn't stop herself from bawling. "It's been so long since we've..." she tried really hard to breath normally but the crying was not helping. "We've had a day together. I don't want to mess things up."

Obli smiled. "I promise you haven't messed anything up besides your makeup. How about I help you finish up here and then we can head out. Deal?"

Slowly her sobs subsided until deep breaths were possible. She didn't mess anything up. Her parents forgave her for oversleeping. The world wasn't going to end. Everything would be okay. Taking another rag from the desk Fade wiped off the rest of her face ready to start over again.

"Hold still," Obli instructed as they started applying more eyeliner.

Within twenty minutes they were out the door. At this point the sun was already well above the mountains shining down on what turned out to be a pretty fantastic day. The skies were clear with not a single cloud in sight. It was rare for the Fifth Division to have such a clear day. Walking to the edge of the plate, Fade's family boarded the gondola leading to the Fourth Division. Since Obli had to regularly commute down to the Fourth Division for work, they had no troubles getting aboard.

"The view today truly is amazing," Vious observed as the gondola swung back in fourth gently. Regardless of the weather, it was always windy
