Chelsen looked back over his shoulder with a huge grin. Most of the townsfolk were conversing over a hot meal and the warm glow from the bon fire. Everyone would be going home soon, except Chelsen. His father, Mith, was already making his way back to their house stumbling with eyes half open. Mith payed no attention to his son who was walking straight to the forest, rather than their home.

Once Chelsen was out of sight from the rest of the townsfolk of Iris, he set off East with his incomplete map in one hand, and black chalk in the other. Chelsen’s eyelids were also starting to become drowsy, but he kept up the pace until he reached the last spot he had marked on his map. Finding a nice patch of moss to sit on, Chelsen rolled out the map and started drawing his surroundings.

The only sound that could be heard was Chelsen’s pen scribbling on his leather map. Tonight, would be a new addition to his project. In the soft moonlight, Chelsen tried to read his previous labels for landmarks he found around the town of Iris. His handwriting was so atrocious that it even took Chelsen time to decipher what he had written. Letting his shoulders relax, Chelsen took in a deep breath and continued his work. No one would be looking for Chelsen tonight. Even the bon fire lighting up the sky in the East was starting to die down.

The moon floated across the sky as Chelsen kept moving from one comfortable moss patch to the next, noting landmarks as he went. It was getting close to dawn when Chelsen closed his map, making the trek back to his house.

Finding his house was never a problem. Even on the darkest nights Chelsen could easily walk straight back to his house following the echos of his father's monolithic snores that always broke the silence that surrounded most of the town of Iris. Chelsen was almost sure that the center of town, or The Circle of Dreams, would most surely wake up if Mith wasn’t rocking them asleep with his quaking snores.

Chelsen whipped the door open far too tired to care that he might accidentally wake up his father (assuming that were possible). Flopping onto his bed, Chelsen too fell into a rhythmic, although much quieter, snore.

Something rough scratched Chelsen’s face. His eyelids instantly flew open in fear. What was that? Eyebrows raised, Chelsen got up and looked around his room. The moonlight seeping in from outside revealed a black dust flying in through the cracks in the walls. Wind hummed along the house shaking the walls far more than they normally would. Even the ceiling was vibrating far too much to be safe. Chelsen peered into his father’s room only to see him snoring with a side of drool. Nothing could wake his father up apparently.

Above the humming of the wind, the front door started making a tapping noise. Chelsen quietly stepped over to investigate. The closer he got to the front door, the louder the tapping became. When Chelsen touched the front door, the tapping turned into banging. Instinctively Chelsen jumped back. The banging turned into tapping again. Hands now trembling, Chelsen touched the handle only to be thrown back by the door swinging open.

A man stood at the door looking horrible bruised, but not disfigured. It was almost as if someone had painted his skin black and blue. Black dust that was scrapping the side of the building now rushed into the house. The man took one step forward and fell straight on his face. Chelsen tried to close the door, but the fallen man was in the way. Black dust kept flooding the room until Chelsen could see nothing: not even the moonlight seeping in.
